it is Kate Whitney How you startled me Kate I had not an idea who you were when you came in I didn t know what to do so I came straight to you That was always the way Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse It was very sweet of you to come Now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed Oh no no I want the doctor s advice and,A
hollow of his hand Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle By Jove Peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed I suppose you know what you have got A diamond sir A precious stone It cuts into glass as though it were putty It s more than a precious stone It is _the_ precious stone Not the Countess of Morcar s blue carbuncle I ejaculated Precisely so I ought to know its size and shape seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately It is absolutely unique and its value can only,A
quite so bulky but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force This incident gives zest to our investigation however and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her And now Watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors Commons,A
was late before Sherlock Holmes returned He came back alone for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town The glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground On the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey I have seen young McCarthy And what did you learn from him Nothing Could he throw no,A
a day and at such an hour But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady s Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit Come in said he The man who entered was young some two and twenty at the outside well groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his,A
and I have lost a fifty guinea fee and what have I gained Experience said Holmes laughing Indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence X THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR The Lord St Simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves Fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four,A
cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor Pray be precise as to details said he It is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory The manor house is as I have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings Of these bedrooms the first is Dr Roylott s the second my sister s and the third my own,A
you must on no account lose another instant We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me You must get home instantly and act What shall I do There is but one thing to do It must be done at once You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains You must assert that in such words as,A
that they were all three away from the ship last night I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo By the time that their sailing ship reaches Savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder There is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute,A
grass within a few paces of the body Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross who have referred the case to the next Assizes Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court I could hardly imagine a more damning case I remarked If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered Holmes,A
Holmes that I make a mistake in explaining _Omne ignotum pro magnifico_ you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid Can you not find the advertisement Mr Wilson Yes I have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column Here it is This is what began it all You just read it for yourself sir I took the paper from him and read as follows TO THE RED HEADED LEAGUE On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins of Lebanon,A
in agricultural prices not more than 750 Each daughter can claim an income of 250 in case of marriage It is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent My morning s work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort And now Watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves,A
endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell It must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself My clothes were all sodden with dew and my coat sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night s adventure and I sprang to,A
as I understand By the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall There were none I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room Ah that is suggestive Now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open There are windows in it of course Yes but very small ones Too narrow for anyone to pass through As you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side Now would you have the kindness,A
and wondered what it would be best to do I had a friend once called Maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in Pentonville One day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole I knew that he would be true to me for I knew one or two things about him so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence He would show me how to,A
looked there was no one there The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes That was last Friday Mr Holmes and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said Holmes Oh no sir He was too good and kind to leave me so Why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened I was to be true and that,A
see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me What are you doing there he asked I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me I was admiring your fuller s earth said I I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of,A
her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs She listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to,A
had ceased to enter into my head It was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken looking groom ill kempt and side whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room Accustomed as I was to my friend s amazing powers in the use of disguises I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he With a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable as of old Putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in,A
both my friend and I must spend the night in your room Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment Yes it must be so Let me explain I believe that that is the village inn over there Yes that is the Crown Very good Your windows would be visible from there Certainly You must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back Then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to,A
as I was I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police It was a little past six when I arrived so I went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings Here,A
such a very positive one too She has heard of you and would have your opinion though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done Why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life Her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern Oh Mr Sherlock,A
It is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour Never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details My first glance is always at a woman s sleeve In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser As you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces The double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined The,A
you work it out He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together It is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the,A
was weary and haggard Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick all comprehensive glances You must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm We shall soon set matters right I have no doubt You have come in by train this morning I see You know me then No but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove You must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station The lady gave a,A
mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds Holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while I sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon,A
to wash linen of the sort in public It was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point Of course I did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad Besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel On the contrary said Holmes quietly I,A
it was reported as having cleared from London the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union Texas I think I was not and am not sure which but I knew that the ship must have an American origin What then I searched the Dundee records and when I found that the barque _Lone Star_ was there in January 85 my suspicion became a certainty I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London Yes The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week I went down to,A
and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me I gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the Lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me I heard her voice downstairs but I knew that she could not ascend Swiftly I threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments,A
pistol shots Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter Wimpole Street Harley Street and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced white aproned landlord Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he My geese,A
into the street Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare good fortune met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat The inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which Mr St Clair had last been seen There was no sign of him there In fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of,A
minutes past four I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse I want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots I think Watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross But I think I have the key of the affair now And where is it I asked smiling In the bathroom he answered Oh yes I am not joking he continued seeing my look,A
leaving me palpitating with horror I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter K three times repeated There was nothing else save the five dried pips What could be the reason of his overpowering terror I left the breakfast table and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other They may do what they like but I ll checkmate,A

miles or so from Eyford that was all I knew but whether north south east or west I had no idea For that matter Reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all Yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country I paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty guinea fee Suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness,A

direction in which all this points The culprit is Mr John Turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting room and ushering in a visitor The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure His slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character His tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was,A

was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue It was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected On the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated There was a group,A
intellectual problem And first as to how it came here It arrived upon Christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is I have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of Peterson s fire The facts are these about four o clock on Christmas morning Peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road In front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his,A

And now I will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell You didn t know this dead man McCarthy He was a devil incarnate I tell you that God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he His grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life I ll tell you first how I came to be in his power It was in the early 60 s at the diggings I was a young chap,A

Opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate I began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face His lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand K K K he shrieked and then My God my God my sins have overtaken me What is it uncle I cried Death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room,A
eighteen and Turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood McCarthy kept two servants a man and a girl Turner had a considerable household some half dozen at the least That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families Now for the facts On June 3rd that is on Monday,A

shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red headed League You see Watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League and the copying of the _Encyclopædia_ must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out,A

No the debt is not to me You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do should I ever chance to have one Then it was not Arthur who took them I told you yesterday and I repeat to day that it was not You are sure of it Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known He knows it already When I had cleared it all up I had,A

Let us have everything in its due order Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen In the first place I may say that I have met on the whole with no actual ill treatment from Mr and Mrs Rucastle It is only fair to them to say that But I cannot understand them and I am not easy in my mind about them What can you not understand Their reasons for their conduct But you shall have it all just as it occurred When I came down Mr Rucastle met me here,A

the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South Eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date You will observe said Holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers It may well have been cause and effect It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track You can understand that this register,A

As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for self restraint Disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked No no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom But I am so sure,A

every night Mr St Clair is now thirty seven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him I may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 10_s_ while he has 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank There is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind Last Monday Mr Neville St Clair went into town rather,A
passing light Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged At last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive and the carriage came to a stand Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out and as I followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us We stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance,A

feigned indignation at it I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness As to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so,A

of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease Pray sit down on the sofa said Holmes gently You had my note Yes the lodge keeper brought it up You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall And why did you wish to see me He looked across at my companion with despair in,A
the repulsive sneer to the face A twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sad faced refined looking man black haired and smooth skinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment Then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow Great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man I know him from the photograph The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny Be it so,A
attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction This is indeed important said he Ha you find it so Extremely so I congratulate you warmly Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look Why he shrieked you re looking at the wrong side On the contrary this is the right side The right side You re mad Here is the note written in pencil over here And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply There s nothing in it I looked at it,A
evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard so that there is really no tie between them I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered But if he is innocent who has done it Ah who I would call your attention very particularly to two points One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone,A

to discover that there was a deposit of fuller s earth in one of my fields On examining it however I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left both of them however in the grounds of my neighbours These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold mine Naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately I had no capital by,A
son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel She heard Mr McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight She had hardly said the words when young Mr McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he,A
I knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one But among them was Sir George Burnwell I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family Well your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next I went in,A
that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep It must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger All this is amusing though rather elementary but I must go back to business Watson Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr Hosmer Angel I held the little,A

do it again Deeply as I have sinned I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast His cry brought back his son but I had gained the cover of the wood though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight That is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred,A
at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry Cooee before he knew that his son had returned Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends And now let us talk about George Meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow There was no rain as Holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless At nine o clock Lestrade called for,A

that I have done you full justice in the matter I remarked with some coldness for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend s singular character No it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words If I claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself Crime is common Logic is rare Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should,A

I question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family You fill me with interest said Holmes Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze My name said he is John Openshaw but my own affairs have as far as I can understand little to,A

ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society Most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil When these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door,A
which I could do this I took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields This we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press This press as I have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject We guard our secret very jealously however and,A
the door of my room swung slowly open The woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her I would go said,A
She was there in an instant and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out When I cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and I have not seen her since I rose and making my excuses escaped from the house I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait A little over precipitance may ruin all And now I asked Our quest is,A

Daspry there is something more Then to the banker he said You asked for some letters did you not Yes a package of letters Where are they Varin I haven t got them Where are they Varin I don t know My brother had charge of them They are hidden in this room In that case you know where they are How should I know Was it not you who found the hiding place You appear to be as well informed as Salvator The letters are not in the hiding place They are Open it Varin looked at him defiantly,B

the Englishman This speech disconcerted Devanne who replied with a forced smile Fortunately the business has been greatly simplified since I wrote to you In what way The robbery took place last night If you had not announced my intended visit it is probable the robbery would not have been committed last night When then To morrow or some other day And in that case Lupin would have been trapped said the detective And my furniture Would not have been carried away Ah but my goods are here They were brought back at three o clock By Lupin By two,B
ample time to disappear before his double crime was discovered He was still smoking with his eyes fixed upon the window that was now being streaked with drops of rain Once he turned picked up my time table and consulted it The lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order to deceive the enemy But fits of coughing provoked by the smoke exposed her true condition As to me I was very uncomfortable and very tired And I meditated I plotted The train was rushing on joyously intoxicated with its own speed Saint Etienne At that moment,B

there not some shelves against the wall on which she placed her pans and dishes Two shelves to the best of my memory Are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden brackets that support them For if they are not we could be justified in presuming that the child removed them fastened them together and thus formed his bridge Perhaps also since there was a stove we might find the bent poker that he used to open the transom Without saying a word the count left the room and this time those present did not feel,B
And no refreshments Not even a glass of beer Of course you will excuse me as I am here only temporarily Ganimard smiled and accepted the proffered seat Then the prisoner continued Mon Dieu how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man I am so tired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack my pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am not preparing to escape The government is very solicitous on my account It is quite right Why so I should be quite contented if they,B

only six kilometers from the castle a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by the hope of safety After several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective s address the baron visited the office of the Reveil situated on the quai There he found the writer of the article who approaching the window exclaimed Ganimard Why you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his fishing pole I met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on his rod Ah there he is now under the trees That little man wearing a straw,B
of 22 June I took excellent care of your property I feel that I would do you an injustice if I should doubt for one moment your absolute discretion in this affair Your devoted SALVATOR I was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the whimsical nature of his request There was a charming display of confidence and candor in his language and nothing in the world could have induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with ingratitude I gave my servant a theatre ticket and he left the house at eight o clock,B
empty space between the two enormous folios on one of the shelves of the bookcase he said There used to be a book there a book of the sixteenth century entitled Chronique de Thibermesnil which contained the history of the castle since its construction by Duke Rollo on the site of a former feudal fortress There were three engraved plates in the book one of which was a general view of the whole estate another the plan of the buildings and the third I call your attention to it particularly the third was the sketch of a subterranean passage an,B
mission was to guard me while the others carried away their booty Should I rise and seize my revolver Impossible He was there At the least movement at the least cry I was doomed Then came a terrific noise that shook the house this was followed by lighter sounds two or three together like those of a hammer that rebounded At least that was the impression formed in my confused brain These were mingled with other sounds thus creating a veritable uproar which proved that the intruders were not only bold but felt themselves secure from interruption They were right,B
the letters You knew that as soon as you had the letters in your possession you could denounce us Oh no I couldn t part with them He laughed heartily but stopped suddenly and said But enough of this We are merely going over old ground We make no headway We had better let things stand as they are We will not let them stand as they are said the banker and since you have referred to the letters let me tell you that you will not leave this house until you deliver up those letters I shall go when,B
if he were afraid to touch those cursed letters that he had sought so eagerly Then with a nervous movement he took them Close to me I heard a moan I grasped Madame Andermatt s hand It was cold I believe monsieur said Daspry to the banker that our business is ended Oh no thanks It was only by a mere chance that I have been able to do you a good turn Good night Mon Andermatt retired He carried with him the letters written by his wife to Louis Lacombe Marvelous exclaimed Daspry delighted Everything is coming our way,B
with Madame Andermatt in the centre The clock struck nine A few minutes later the garden gate creaked upon its hinges I confess that I was greatly agitated I was about to learn the key to the mystery The startling events of the last few weeks were about to be explained and under my eyes the last battle was going to be fought Daspry seized the hand of Madame Andermatt and said to her Not a word not a movement Whatever you may see or hear keep quiet Some one entered It was Alfred Varin I recognized him at once,B
now Now replied Lupin I am going to take a rest enjoy the best of food and drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition It is all very well to become Baudru or some other person on occasion and to change your personality as you do your shirt but you soon grow weary of the change I feel exactly as I imagine the man who lost his shadow must have felt and I shall be glad to be Arsène Lupin once more He walked to and fro for a few minutes then stopping in front of Ganimard he said,B

having been burned under the Directoire by Barras during a night of debauchery Consult the memoirs of Garat I do not care for the Louis XV chatelaine as I doubt its authenticity That letter completely upset the baron Had it borne any other signature he would have been greatly alarmed but signed by Arsène Lupin As an habitual reader of the newspapers he was versed in the history of recent crimes and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of the mysterious burglar Of course he knew that Lupin had been arrested in America by his enemy Ganimard and was,B

letter in which Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft caused considerable excitement The most fabulous theories were advanced Some recalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels and that was the line of research pursued by the officers of the law who searched the house from top to bottom questioned every stone studied the wainscoting and the chimneys the window frames and the girders in the ceilings By the light of torches they examined the immense cellars where the lords of Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and provisions They sounded the rocky foundation to its,B

the night of 27 September To confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature but now for the first time in many years he experienced the necessity of seeking counsel with some one Abandoned by the legal official of his own district and feeling unable to defend himself with his own resources he was on the point of going to Paris to engage the services of a detective Two days passed on the third day he was filled with hope and joy as he read the following item in the Reveil de Caudebec a newspaper published in,B

of patient investigation the problem remained unsolved The poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison indefinitely and to place him on trial would be ridiculous There was no charge against him Consequently he was released but the chief of the Sûrété resolved to keep him under surveillance This idea originated with Ganimard From his point of view there was neither complicity nor chance Baudru was an instrument upon which Arsène Lupin had played with his extraordinary skill Baudru when set at liberty would lead them to Arsène Lupin or at least to some of his accomplices,B
the papers relating to his invention Two days later my husband in a conversation with one of the Varin brothers learned that the papers were in their possession And he did not denounce them No Why not Because there was something else in the satchel something besides the papers of Louis Lacombe What was it She hesitated was on the point of speaking but finally remained silent Daspry continued I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over their movements instead of informing the police He hoped to recover the papers and at the same time,B
then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed and that some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of tranquility For a moment we were silent and embarrassed Then Daspry stepped forward and said Will you permit me to ask you a few questions Yes yes she cried I will answer You will answer whatever those questions may be Yes Did you know Louis Lacombe he asked Yes through my husband When did you see him for the last time The evening he dined with us At that time was there anything to lead you to believe that,B
from his assistants He looked at Baudru The latter was asleep on the bench his head rolling from side to side his mouth half opened and an incredible expression of stupidity on his blotched face No such an adversary was incapable of deceiving old Ganimard It was a stroke of luck nothing more At the Galleries Lafayette the man leaped from the omnibus and took the La Muette tramway following the boulevard Haussmann and the avenue Victor Hugo Baudru alighted at La Muette station and with a nonchalant air strolled into the Bois de Boulogne He wandered through one path,B

day and night when you have not had the company of either Myers or myself Robert Brierly threw back his head and folded his arms After a moment of silence he got up and stood before the detective Ferrars he said I owe you and my absent friend an abject apology for my unworthy suspicions my impatience under restraint And now I beg of you let this end I am warned and I do not think myself a rash man I believe I can protect myself and how can I endure the thought that I must be hedged about by,C
and even rested or seemed so to do To be baffled in a small town and by a small boy was something new and surprising in the experience of detective Ferrars but so it was Work as he would finesse as he might he could find no trace of the boy about half grown with dark eyes and hair freckles a polite way with him and a cap pulled over his eyes and this was the best description Mrs Fry could give of the strange lad If Mrs Fry was not the honest woman she is said the doctor I,C

s cottage was still headquarters for them all while Ferrars now had solitary possession of the guest chamber formerly assigned to Brierly Mr Myers was a shrewd lawyer as well as a faithful family friend He had felt from the first that there was mystery as well as crime behind the death of Charles Brierly who had been near and dear to him as dear as an own son for the two families had been almost as one ever since John Myers and the elder Brierly who had been school friends and fellow students finally entered together the career of,C
The writing desk which later Mrs Fry declared to have been closed was now open and a portion of the contents of its usually neatly arranged pigeon holes was scattered upon the leaf This said Brierly as they approached it was closed when I saw it last night I remember Ferrars nodded and sat down in the revolving chair before the desk and without touching anything ran his eye carefully over the scattered papers examined the pigeon holes the locks and even the fine coating of dust Upon a round table near the front window were some scattered books mostly,C
with his friend later hurried back to his hotel where he found a cablegram awaiting him Previous to his departure from New York Ferrars had given him a code by which to frame any needful cable messages concerning the business of the journey or the people whom it concerned The detective had warned all of the little group now so closely bound together by mutual interest and in the same endeavour to be constantly on guard against spies Unless I am greatly mistaken he said every effort will be made to keep in view all who are known to be,C

given to half uttered soliloquy when he knew himself among safe people and could therefore afford to relax his guard Likewise he failed to say the things which Brierly at least expected and much desired to hear His first movement after the three had breakfasted was to ask for the keys of the cottage chambers for they had been handed over to Brierly somewhat ostentatiously in the presence of Mrs Fry and at the foot of the cottage stairs by the doctor I want to spend another half hour in those rooms he said and to so leave them that,C

good woman entered Ferrars was seated by the furthest window and Robert Brierly met her at the door Mrs Fry he began will you kindly look about you without of course disturbing or changing things and tell us if you see anything that has changed If you miss anything or if anything in your opinion has been tampered with Look through both rooms carefully and then give us your opinion Mrs Fry who had been expecting just such a summons and who fully realised the gravity of the occasion stood still in her place near the door and looked slowly,C

host Next morning Mrs Myers declared herself more than ready to leave Glenville The thought of being in a house where an intruder found it so easy to make free with a lady s wardrobe was not pleasant and she hoped Ruth would not ask her to spend another week in the town In fact she only stipulated for a fortnight s visit with her friend Miss Grant upon which Ruth promised that they would really go very soon although she was enjoying herself Three days later a party of the Glenville s guests set off after an early breakfast,C

for a long half hour awaiting him alone in the little drawing room Her face was somewhat pale and there was a hint of agitation in her greeting and a shade of gravity in his She talked of Hilda and was full of pleasure at their meeting and by and by she spoke of Ruth her beauty her grace and style Was it true that she was an heiress And was she not in some way related to Miss Hilda and himself Or perhaps to the Brierlys It was the first mention of that name by either and Ferrars looking,C

at any rate until the end of the war John I knew was very fond of her and would be sorry to let her go John who had gone into the house now reappeared His good natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger Confound those detectives I can t think what they re after They ve been in every room in the house turning things inside out and upside down It really is too bad I suppose they took advantage of our all being out I shall go for that fellow Japp when I next see him Lot of,D
said I ll do everything I can but I m sure you re excited and overwrought She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger Young man trust me I ve lived in the world rather longer than you have All I ask you is to keep your eyes open You ll see what I mean The throb of the motor came through the open window and Miss Howard rose and moved to the door John s voice sounded outside With her hand on the handle she turned her head over her shoulder and beckoned to me Above all Mr Hastings,D
would go unpunished Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man But did everyone suspect him What about Mrs Cavendish I watched her as she sat at the head of the table graceful composed enigmatic In her soft grey frock with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands she looked very beautiful When she chose however her face could be sphinx like in its inscrutability She was very silent hardly opening her lips and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her personality was,D
and took it in I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement Unknown to herself Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence How she would have gaped if she had realized that her coarse kitchen salt was strychnine one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind I marvelled at Poirot s calm His self control was astonishing I awaited his next question with impatience but it disappointed me When you went into Mrs Inglethorp s room was the door leading into Miss Cynthia s room bolted Oh Yes sir it always was It had never,D
no harm in it He said it was to poison a dog Inwardly I sympathized It was only human nature to endeavour to please The Hall especially when it might result in custom being transferred from Coot s to the local establishment Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book Yes sir Mr Inglethorp did so Have you got the book here Yes sir It was produced and with a few words of stern censure the Coroner dismissed the wretched Mr Mace Then amidst a breathless silence Alfred Inglethorp was called Did he realize I wondered,D
tell you I have an idea that I was out walking In what direction I really can t remember The Coroner s face grew graver Were you in company with anyone No Did you meet anyone on your walk No That is a pity said the Coroner dryly I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr Mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine If you like to take it that way yes Be careful Mr Inglethorp Poirot was fidgeting nervously _Sacré _ he murmured Does,D
hatter and then just as he is at his maddest I find there is method in his madness I see In spite of her laugh Mary was looking thoughtful this morning She seemed grave almost sad It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of Cynthia I began rather tactfully _I_ thought but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively You are an excellent advocate I have no doubt Mr Hastings but in this case your talents are quite thrown away Cynthia will run no risk of encountering,D
her afraid that she was going to faint I found her leaning against the bannisters deadly pale She waved me away impatiently No no leave me I d rather be alone Let me just be quiet for a minute or two Go down to the others I obeyed her reluctantly John and Lawrence were in the dining room I joined them We were all silent but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of us all when I at last broke it by saying Where is Mr Inglethorp John shook his head He s not in the house Our eyes met,D
is that Mrs Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning presumably administered in her coffee Yes Well what time was the coffee served About eight o clock Therefore she drank it between then and half past eight certainly not much later Well strychnine is a fairly rapid poison Its effects would be felt very soon probably in about an hour Yet in Mrs Inglethorp s case the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o clock the next morning nine hours But a heavy meal taken at about the same time as the poison might retard its effects though hardly to that,D
Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory It has to be examined sifted But here the whole thing is cut and dried No my friend this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends How do you make that out Because so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible it was very hard to disprove But in his anxiety the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free I was silent And in a minute or two Poirot continued Let us look at the,D
paused a minute then went on Now to my way of thinking there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard s being the murderess And that is That in no possible way could Mrs Inglethorp s death benefit Miss Howard Now there is no murder without a motive I reflected Could not Mrs Inglethorp have made a will in her favour Poirot shook his head But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr Wells Poirot smiled That was for a reason I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind Miss Howard,D
If I choose You defy me No but I deny your right to criticize my actions Have _you_ no friends of whom I should disapprove John fell back a pace The colour ebbed slowly from his face What do you mean he said in an unsteady voice You see said Mary quietly You _do_ see don t you that _you_ have no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends John glanced at her pleadingly a stricken look on his face No right Have I _no_ right Mary he said unsteadily He stretched out his hands,D
look through carefully Yes said the lawyer it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession There _is_ a later will It was Poirot who spoke What John and the lawyer looked at him startled Or rather pursued my friend imperturbably there _was_ one What do you mean there was one Where is it now Burnt Burnt Yes See here He took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in Mrs Inglethorp s room and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he,D
at the inquest about the letter she had received from Mrs Inglethorp Why what was there to lie about You saw that letter Do you recall its general appearance Yes more or less You will recollect then that Mrs Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand and left large clear spaces between her words But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that July 17th is quite different in this respect Do you see what I mean No I confessed I don t You do not see that that letter was not written,D
might open it the first day and Mrs Crosbie the second Then there s the Duchess about the school fête There was the murmur of a man s voice and then Mrs Inglethorp s rose in reply Yes certainly After tea will do quite well You are so thoughtful Alfred dear The French window swung open a little wider and a handsome white haired old lady with a somewhat masterful cast of features stepped out of it on to the lawn A man followed her a suggestion of deference in his manner Mrs Inglethorp greeted me with effusion Why if,D

swiftly passed out of the little glade leaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone Rather ostentatiously I stepped forward crackling some dead branches with my feet as I did so John turned Luckily he took it for granted that I had only just come upon the scene Hullo Hastings Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage Quaint little chap Is he any good though really He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day Oh well I suppose there must be something in it then What a rotten world,D
were quite erroneous He smiled You gave too much rein to your imagination Imagination is a good servant and a bad master The simplest explanation is always the most likely Another point how did you know that the key of the despatch case had been lost I did not know it It was a guess that turned out to be correct You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key ring Now if it had been lost and recovered Mrs,D
is only suspicion so far We have nothing to go upon Precisely It is a matter of precaution only John turned to me taking out his cigarette case and lighting a cigarette as he did so You know that fellow Inglethorp is back Yes I met him John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed a proceeding which was too much for Poirot s feelings He retrieved it and buried it neatly It s jolly difficult to know how to treat him That difficulty will not exist long pronounced Poirot quietly John looked puzzled not quite understanding the portent,D
But how had anyone gained admission All the doors had been bolted on the inside Now my friend said Poirot briskly we will go I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid Dorcas her name is is it not We passed through Alfred Inglethorp s room and Poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it We went out through that door locking both it and that of Mrs Inglethorp s room as before I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see and went myself,D
it is though You find it so I asked Good Lord yes There s this terrible business to start with Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack in the box Never know where they won t turn up next Screaming headlines in every paper in the country damn all journalists I say Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning Sort of Madame Tussaud s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing Pretty thick isn t it Cheer up John I said soothingly It,D
brother I am convinced had no more to do with the crime than I have Sir Ernest merely smiled and noted with a sharp eye that John s protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury Then the cross examination began I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of Mr Inglethorp Is not that very surprising No I don t think so I was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and Mr Inglethorp and it never occurred,D
with her every morning and took it up every night When did she lose the key of it She missed it yesterday at lunch time sir and told me to look carefully for it She was very much put out about it But she had a duplicate key Oh yes sir Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and to tell the truth so was I What was all this about a lost key Poirot smiled Never mind Dorcas it is my business to know things Is this the key that was lost He drew from his pocket the key,D
in search of Dorcas When I returned with her however the boudoir was empty Poirot I cried where are you I am here my friend He had stepped outside the French window and was standing apparently lost in admiration before the various shaped flower beds Admirable he murmured Admirable What symmetry Observe that crescent and those diamonds their neatness rejoices the eye The spacing of the plants also is perfect It has been recently done is it not so Yes I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon But come in Dorcas is here _Eh bien eh bien _ Do,D
that settles it And Poirot looked crestfallen I could not help rejoicing that for once one of his little ideas had come to naught After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home I consented rather stiffly You are annoyed is it not so he asked anxiously as we walked through the park Not at all I said coldly That is well That lifts a great load from my mind This was not quite what I had intended I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner Still the fervour of his words went towards the,D
terrible slip of paper The contents of the waste paper basket are kept and in any case are sure to be examined There are no means of destroying it and he dare not keep it He looks round and he sees what do you think _mon ami _ I shook my head In a moment he has torn the letter into long thin strips and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle piece I uttered an exclamation No one would think of looking there Poirot continued And,D
any unkindness from me I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn t thought But again she stopped me and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove Cynthia and her troubles out of my mind Mr Hastings she said do you think I and my husband are happy together I was considerably taken aback and murmured something about it s not being my business to think anything of the sort Well she said quietly whether it is your business or not I will tell you that we are _not_ happy I said nothing for I saw,D
the Apartments card inserted in the window where I knew he lodged and tapped on the door An old woman came and opened it Good afternoon I said pleasantly Is Dr Bauerstein in She stared at me Haven t you heard Heard what About him What about him He s took Took Dead No took by the perlice By the police I gasped Do you mean they ve arrested him Yes that s it and I waited to hear no more but tore up the village to find Poirot CHAPTER X THE ARREST To my extreme annoyance Poirot was not,D
my mother in law s room but it was locked The Coroner interrupted her I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before I There was a faint insolence in her voice She raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck turning her head a little as she did so And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind She is gaining,D
death she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake However that may be my father was broken hearted Shortly afterwards he went into the Consular Service Everywhere he went I went with him When I was twenty three I had been nearly all over the world It was a splendid life I loved it There was a smile on her face and her head was thrown back She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days Then my father died He left me very badly off I had to go and live with some old aunts,D
had broken and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness Mary shivered a little and buttoned her black sports coat closer The wind through the trees made a mournful noise like some great giant sighing We walked up to the great door of Styles and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong Dorcas came running out to meet us She was crying and wringing her hands I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background all eyes and ears Oh m am Oh m am I don t know how to tell,D
offended sometimes Said I was foolishly proud It wasn t that but I couldn t explain Anyway I kept my self respect And so out of the whole bunch I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her I watched over her I guarded her from the lot of them and then a glib tongued scoundrel comes along and pooh all my years of devotion go for nothing Poirot nodded sympathetically I understand mademoiselle I understand all you feel It is most natural You think that we are lukewarm that we lack fire and energy,D
that she had not finished She began slowly walking up and down the room her head a little bent and that slim supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked She stopped suddenly and looked up at me You don t know anything about me do you she asked Where I come from who I was before I married John anything in fact Well I will tell you I will make a father confessor of you You are kind I think yes I am sure you are kind Somehow I was not quite as elated as I might have,D

It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be Unfortunately no That is a pity said John A great pity agreed Poirot gravely There was silence Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes Finally he turned to the lawyer again Mr Wells there is one thing I should like to ask you that is if it is not against professional etiquette In the event of Mrs Inglethorp s death who would,D
this imbecile of a man _want_ to be arrested Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression His futile denials would not have convinced a child The Coroner however passed briskly to the next point and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon Pardon me interrupted Alfred Inglethorp you have been misinformed I had no quarrel with my dear wife The whole story is absolutely untrue I was absent from the house the entire afternoon Have you anyone who can testify to that You have my word said Inglethorp haughtily The,D
in his arms he kissed me warmly on both cheeks and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room Mary Cavendish entered at that moment What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot He rushed past me crying out A garage For the love of Heaven direct me to a garage madame And before I could answer he had dashed out into the street I hurried to the window True enough there he was tearing down the street hatless and gesticulating as he went I turned to Mary with a gesture of despair He ll be stopped,D
never suspected it It never entered my head It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night fully dressed No I confessed I never thought of such a thing He is of course a German by birth said Poirot thoughtfully though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman He was naturalized about fifteen years ago A very clever man a Jew of,D
where women are concerned but I remembered certain evidences too lightly thought of at the time perhaps but which certainly seemed to indicate My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper This she handed to Poirot murmuring as she did so the cryptic words On top of the wardrobe Then she hurriedly left the room Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction He spread it out,D
sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed John interrupted just as I had done But look here Bauerstein had had it analysed already Yes yes that s the point I didn t see it either until now Don t you understand Bauerstein had it analysed that s just it If Bauerstein s the murderer nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample and send that to be tested And of course they would find no strychnine But no one would dream of suspecting Bauerstein or think of taking another sample except Poirot,D
I don t know what possessed me Her beauty perhaps as she sat there with the sunlight glinting down on her head perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness Anyway I leant forward and taking her little hand I said awkwardly Marry me Cynthia Unwittingly I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears She sat up at once drew her hand away and said with some asperity Don t be silly I was a little annoyed I m not,D
in Yorkshire She shuddered You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been The narrowness the deadly monotony of it almost drove me mad She paused a minute and added in a different tone And then I met John Cavendish Yes You can imagine that from my aunts point of view it was a very good match for me But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me No he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my,D
on the table Come here Hastings Now tell me what is that initial J or L It was a medium sized sheet of paper rather dusty as though it had lain by for some time But it was the label that was attracting Poirot s attention At the top it bore the printed stamp of Messrs Parkson s the well known theatrical costumiers and it was addressed to the debatable initial Cavendish Esq Styles Court Styles St Mary Essex It might be T or it might be L I said after studying the thing for a minute or two It,D

case She looked excited and determined and slightly on the defensive At any rate she burst out I ve spoken my mind My dear Evelyn cried Mrs Cavendish this can t be true Miss Howard nodded grimly True enough Afraid I said some things to Emily she won t forget or forgive in a hurry Don t mind if they ve only sunk in a bit Probably water off a duck s back though I said right out You re an old woman Emily and there s no fool like an old fool The man s twenty years younger than,D
the crime and it struck me as being very unreal and far off I yawned again Probably I thought it really never happened Of course it was all a bad dream The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet But it was absurd of John to make such a fuss about it and to go shouting out I tell you I won t have it I woke up with a start At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament For about twelve feet away from,D
recalling unpleasant memories but I have a little idea Poirot s little ideas were becoming a perfect byword and would like to ask one or two questions Of me Certainly You are too amiable madame What I want to ask is this the door leading into Mrs Inglethorp s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia it was bolted you say Certainly it was bolted replied Mary Cavendish rather surprised I said so at the inquest Bolted Yes She looked perplexed I mean explained Poirot you are sure it was bolted and not merely locked Oh I see what you mean,D
matter like this Here is a man let us say who sets out to poison his wife He has lived by his wits as the saying goes Presumably therefore he has some wits He is not altogether a fool Well how does he set about it He goes boldly to the village chemist s and purchases strychnine under his own name with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd He does not employ the poison that night No he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her of which the whole,D
low down I protested Not at all We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man and we must use any means in our power otherwise he will slip through our fingers That is why I have been careful to remain in the background All the discoveries have been made by Japp and Japp will take all the credit If I am called upon to give evidence at all he smiled broadly it will probably be as a witness for the defence I could hardly believe my ears It is quite _en règle_ continued Poirot Strangely enough I,D
that got to do with it Poirot shrugged his shoulders Surely it is obvious Not to me No doubt I am very dense but I cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs Inglethorp Nothing at all of course replied Poirot smiling But we were speaking of the arrest of Dr Bauerstein Well he is arrested for the murder of Mrs Inglethorp What cried Poirot in apparently lively astonishment Dr Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs Inglethorp Yes Impossible That would be too good a farce Who told you that,D
glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before Poirot opened the proceedings I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative _Mesdames_ and _messieurs_ said Poirot bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture I have asked you to come here all together for a certain object That object it concerns Mr Alfred Inglethorp Inglethorp was sitting a little by himself I think unconsciously everyone had drawn his chair slightly away from him and he gave a faint start,D
but recognizable Ah I cried That was what you sealed up in the envelope Yes It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs Inglethorp s own dresses and quite unimportant We shall see Five _this_ With a dramatic gesture he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing table It must have been done since yesterday otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting paper and a hot iron One of my best hats once but that is not to the point It was very likely,D
by a policeman in another minute There he goes round the corner Our eyes met and we stared helplessly at one another What can be the matter I shook my head I don t know He was building card houses when suddenly he said he had an idea and rushed off as you saw Well said Mary I expect he will be back before dinner But night fell and Poirot had not returned CHAPTER XII THE LAST LINK Poirot s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly Sunday morning wore away and still he did not reappear But about three,D
village gossip that you mind But it isn t I ve had enough of the fellow hanging about He s a Polish Jew anyway A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing It leavens the she looked at him stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman Fire in her eyes ice in her voice I did not wonder that the blood rose to John s face in a crimson tide Mary Well Her tone did not change The pleading died out of his voice Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my express wishes,D
five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing Figure to yourself the scene He enters the room unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys they were all much alike He hurries to the despatch case it is locked and the keys are nowhere to be seen That is a terrible blow to him for it means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped But he sees clearly,D
Mr Inglethorp was leaving that morning to take up his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his plans And really it s a great relief to think he s going Hastings continued my honest friend It was bad enough before when we thought he d done it but I m hanged if it isn t worse now when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow The fact is we ve treated him abominably Of course things did look black against him I don t see how anyone could blame us for,D
hands He sprang up at my entrance What is it I asked solicitously You are not ill I trust No no not ill But I decide an affair of great moment Whether to catch the criminal or not I asked facetiously But to my great surprise Poirot nodded gravely To speak or not to speak as your so great Shakespeare says that is the question I did not trouble to correct the quotation You are not serious Poirot I am of the most serious For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance And that is A woman,D
Styles Mr Wells told me as we were going upstairs What was it Locked up in the desk in the boudoir they found a will of Mrs Inglethorp s dated before her marriage leaving her fortune to Alfred Inglethorp It must have been made just at the time they were engaged It came quite as a surprise to Wells and to John Cavendish also It was written on one of those printed will forms and witnessed by two of the servants not Dorcas Did Mr Inglethorp know of it He says not One might take that with a grain of,D
And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will She might have burnt the new one mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour She is so terribly bitter against him You consider her vehemence unnatural Y es She is so very violent I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point Poirot shook his head energetically No no you are on a wrong tack there There is nothing weak minded or degenerate about Miss Howard She is an excellent specimen of well balanced English beef and brawn She is sanity,D
t Mr Poirot cried the Inspector He turned to the other man You ve heard me speak of Mr Poirot It was in 1904 he and I worked together the Abercrombie forgery case you remember he was run down in Brussels Ah those were great days moosier Then do you remember Baron Altara There was a pretty rogue for you He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe But we nailed him in Antwerp thanks to Mr Poirot here As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in I drew nearer and was introduced to Detective Inspector Japp who,D
a wooden hand in mine and said This is a pleasure Mr Hastings Then turning to his wife Emily dearest I think that cushion is a little damp She beamed fondly on him as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman With the presence of Mr Inglethorp a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company Miss Howard in particular took no pains to conceal her feelings Mrs Inglethorp however seemed to notice nothing unusual Her volubility which I remembered of old had lost nothing,D
into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared What has happened to your extraordinary little friend Mr Hastings He has just rushed past me like a mad bull He s rather upset about something I remarked feebly I really did not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose As I saw a faint smile gather on Mrs Cavendish s expressive mouth I endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying They haven t met yet have they Who Mr Inglethorp and Miss Howard She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner Do you,D
Yes isn t it We were silent for a minute or two and then glancing in the direction of Mary Cavendish and dropping her voice Cynthia said Mr Hastings Yes After tea I want to talk to you Her glance at Mary had set me thinking I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy For the first time it occurred to me to wonder about the girl s future Mrs Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her making her home with them,D
table had played her the same trick What happened next is mere guess work on my part but I should say that Mrs Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind she heated up her cocoa and drank it off then and there Now we are faced with a new problem We know the cocoa contained no strychnine The coffee was never drunk Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o clock that evening What third medium was there a,D
uniform ran lightly across the lawn Why Cynthia you are late to day This is Mr Hastings Miss Murdoch Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh looking young creature full of life and vigour She tossed off her little V A D cap and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty She flung herself down on the ground beside John and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at,D
own eyes have told us that yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor and the destruction of the will prove that during the night someone entered the room You agree so far Perfectly Put with admirable clearness Proceed Well I said encouraged as the person who entered did not do so by the window nor by miraculous means it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs Inglethorp herself That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband She would naturally open the door to her own husband Poirot shook,D
No I don t know I said bolted meaning that it was fastened and I could not open it but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside Still as far as you are concerned the door might equally well have been locked Oh yes You yourself did not happen to notice madame when you entered Mrs Inglethorp s room whether that door was bolted or not I I believe it was But you did not see it No I never looked But _I_ did interrupted Lawrence suddenly I happened to notice that it _was_ bolted Ah,D
you and don t you fool yourself as to what he married you for Money Well don t let him have too much of it Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there She was very angry Natural I went on I m going to warn you whether you like it or not That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you He s a bad lot You can say what you like to me but remember what I ve told you He,D
in a word what do you think _Mon Dieu _ I had some warm moments in that court I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig headed as to refuse to say anything at all Decidedly it was the policy of an imbecile H m There are other explanations besides that of imbecility I remarked For if the case against him is true how could he defend himself except by silence Why in a thousand ingenious ways cried Poirot See say that it is I who have committed this murder I can think of seven,D
unless he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate The fire burns and it destroys But by chance there might be let us see Deftly on hands and knees he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender handling them with the greatest caution Suddenly he gave a faint exclamation The forceps Hastings I quickly handed them to him and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper There _mon ami _ he cried What do you think of that I scrutinized the fragment This is an exact reproduction of,D
Ernest fairly shot the next question at him Did you examine one bottle in particular No I do not think so Be careful Mr Cavendish I am referring to a little bottle of Hydro chloride of Strychnine Lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour N o I am sure I didn t Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger prints on it The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition I I suppose I must have taken up the bottle I suppose so too Did you abstract any,D
the idea What Mr Cavendish suggests is quite impossible Any doctor would tell you the same Strychnine is in a certain sense a cumulative poison but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention The whole thing is absurd And the second suggestion That Mrs Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose Three or even four doses would not have resulted in death Mrs Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made,D
you sir she said to John I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs Inglethorp had written the night before John rose immediately Show him into my study Then he turned to us My mother s lawyer he explained And in a lower voice He is also Coroner you understand Perhaps you would like to come with me We acquiesced and followed him out of the room John strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot There will be an inquest then Poirot nodded absently He seemed absorbed in thought so,D
lively curiosity In the waste paper basket You recognise the handwriting Yes it is Mrs Inglethorp s But what does it mean Poirot shrugged his shoulders I cannot say but it is suggestive A wild idea flashed across me Was it possible that Mrs Inglethorp s mind was deranged Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession And if that were so was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life I was about to expound these theories to Poirot when his own words distracted me Come he said now to examine the coffee cups My,D
not grudge me a moment s satisfaction of the eye Yes but this affair is more important And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance I shrugged my shoulders There was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line You do not agree But such things have been Well we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas Dorcas was standing in the boudoir her hands folded in front of her and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap She was the very model and picture,D
he came to Styles They had already arranged their infamous plot that he should marry this rich but rather foolish old lady induce her to make a will leaving her money to him and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime If all had gone as they planned they would probably have left England and lived together on their poor victim s money They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair While suspicion was to be directed against him she would be making quiet preparations for a very different _dénouement_ She arrives from Middlingham with all the,D
drunk it I don t know what to do she says Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing Dorcas I d rather hush it up if I could Mrs Cavendish came in just then so she didn t say any more She still had the letter or whatever it was in her hand Yes sir What would she be likely to do with it afterwards Well I don t know sir I expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers Is that where she usually kept important papers Yes sir She brought it down,D
know but still who else is there Can t you guess No I looked cautiously round and lowered my voice Dr Bauerstein I whispered Impossible Not at all But what earthly interest could he have in my mother s death That I don t see I confessed but I ll tell you this Poirot thinks so Poirot Does he How do you know I told him of Poirot s intense excitement on hearing that Dr Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night and added He said twice That alters everything And I ve been thinking You know Inglethorp,D
that he had found in the lock of the despatch case upstairs Dorcas s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head That s it sir right enough But where did you find it I looked everywhere for it Ah but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to day Now to pass to another subject had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question No sir Are you quite sure Oh yes sir Has anyone else in the house got a,D
events of that afternoon Plain as a pikestaff to me said Miss Howard shortly It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she d been made a fool of It says nothing of the kind in the letter the Coroner pointed out No because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong But _I_ know her She wanted me back But she wasn t going to own that I d been right She went round about Most people do Don t believe in it myself Mr Wells smiled faintly So I noticed did,D
doctor in the latter laughing and protesting that he was in no fit state for a drawing room In truth he presented a sorry spectacle being literally plastered with mud What have you been doing doctor cried Mrs Cavendish I must make my apologies said the doctor I did not really mean to come in but Mr Inglethorp insisted Well Bauerstein you are in a plight said John strolling in from the hall Have some coffee and tell us what you have been up to Thank you I will He laughed rather ruefully as he described how he had discovered,D
not repeat it here The next witness was Mary Cavendish She stood very upright and spoke in a low clear and perfectly composed voice In answer to the Coroner s question she told how her alarm clock having aroused her at four thirty as usual she was dressing when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling That would have been the table by the bed commented the Coroner I opened my door continued Mary and listened In a few minutes a bell rang violently Dorcas came running down and woke my husband and we all went to,D
John said I m afraid you ll find it very quiet down here Hastings My dear fellow that s just what I want Oh it s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life I drill with the volunteers twice a week and lend a hand at the farms My wife works regularly on the land She is up at five every morning to milk and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime It s a jolly good life taking it all round if it weren t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp He checked the car suddenly and glanced,D
results from it Suddenly he gave an exclamation What is it Look The chest was nearly empty and there reposing right at the bottom was a magnificent black beard _Ohó _ said Poirot _Ohó _ He turned it over in his hands examining it closely New he remarked Yes quite new After a moment s hesitation he replaced it in the chest heaped all the other things on top of it as before and made his way briskly downstairs He went straight to the pantry where we found Dorcas busily polishing her silver Poirot wished her good morning with Gallic,D

powders One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine as the book describes and cause it to be taken in the last dose You will learn later that the person who usually poured out Mrs Inglethorp s medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed Throughout the case there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening On that day Mrs Inglethorp s bell wire was neatly cut and on Monday,D
dear Poirot What on earth is the good of that now that we know about the cocoa Oh _là là _ That miserable cocoa cried Poirot flippantly He laughed with apparent enjoyment raising his arms to heaven in mock despair in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste And anyway I said with increasing coldness as Mrs Inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her I do not see what you expect to find unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray Poirot was sobered at once Come come,D
because I won t I wouldn t lift a finger to to She faltered You will help me in spite of yourself I ask you nothing but you will be my ally You will not be able to help yourself You will do the only thing that I want of you And that is You will watch Evelyn Howard bowed her head Yes I can t help doing that I am always watching always hoping I shall be proved wrong If we are wrong well and good said Poirot No one will be more pleased than I shall But if,D
And when did you take it into Mrs Inglethorp s room When I went to shut up sir About eight o clock Mrs Inglethorp came up to bed before I d finished Then between seven fifteen and eight o clock the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing Yes sir Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face and now she blurted out unexpectedly And if there _was_ salt in it sir it wasn t me I never took the salt near it What makes you think there was salt in it asked Poirot Seeing,D
can tell you that was a surprise to us all There must be more in this affair of Inglethorp s with Mrs Raikes than we thought to make him hold his tongue so persistently What are you going to do now Where are the Scotland Yard fellows Gone down to interview the servants I showed them all our exhibits I am disappointed in Japp He has no method Hullo I said looking out of the window Here s Dr Bauerstein I believe you re right about that man Poirot I don t like him He is clever observed Poirot meditatively,D
the truth look out Now unless I am much mistaken at the inquest to day only one at most two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge Oh come now Poirot I won t cite Lawrence or Mrs Cavendish But there s John and Miss Howard surely they were speaking the truth Both of them my friend One I grant you but both His words gave me an unpleasant shock Miss Howard s evidence unimportant as it was had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity,D
Annie considered There were four letters sir One was to Miss Howard and one was to Mr Wells the lawyer and the other two I don t think I remember sir oh yes one was to Ross s the caterers in Tadminster The other one I don t remember Think urged Poirot Annie racked her brains in vain I m sorry sir but it s clean gone I don t think I can have noticed it It does not matter said Poirot not betraying any sign of disappointment Now I want to ask you about something else There is a,D
I asked eagerly rather too eagerly perhaps under the circumstances That of course I cannot say but shall I tell you my own private opinion Hastings Yes Well it is this that Mrs Cavendish does not care and never has cared one little jot about Dr Bauerstein Do you really think so I could not disguise my pleasure I am quite sure of it And I will tell you why Yes Because she cares for someone else _mon ami_ Oh What did he mean In spite of myself an agreeable warmth spread over me I am not a vain man,D
life I said nothing and after a moment she went on Don t misunderstand me I was quite honest with him I told him what was true that I liked him very much that I hoped to come to like him more but that I was not in any way what the world calls in love with him He declared that that satisfied him and so we were married She waited a long time a little frown had gathered on her forehead She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days I think I am sure he cared,D
told you he would My dear Evie don t shout so Whatever we may think or suspect it is better to say as little as possible for the present The inquest isn t until Friday Not until fiddlesticks The snort Miss Howard gave was truly magnificent You re all off your heads The man will be out of the country by then If he s any sense he won t stay here tamely and wait to be hanged John Cavendish looked at her helplessly I know what it is she accused him you ve been listening to the doctors Never,D

as the key that had originally stood in the lock into his own pocket I have no authority to go through these papers But it should be done at once He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash stand Crossing the room to the left hand window a round stain hardly visible on the dark brown carpet seemed to interest him particularly He went down on his knees examining it minutely even going so far as to smell it Finally he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube sealing it up,D
on the night of the murder Yes my friend said Poirot unexpectedly we can One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working Well Well I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday and that a convoy coming in unexpectedly she had kindly offered to remain on night duty which offer was gratefully accepted That disposes of that Oh I said rather nonplussed Really I continued it s her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her I can t help feeling she d do anything against him,D

to Cynthia was rather constrained and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him But they were both gay enough this afternoon and chatted together like a couple of children As we drove through the village I remembered that I wanted some stamps so accordingly we pulled up at the post office As I came out again I cannoned into a little man who was just entering I drew aside and apologised when suddenly with a loud exclamation he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly _Mon ami_ Hastings he cried It is indeed,D
to say this to him I have a message for you from Poirot He says Find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace Nothing more Nothing less Find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace Is that right I asked much mystified Excellent But what does it mean Ah that I will leave you to find out You have access to the facts Just say that to him and see what he says Very well but it s all extremely mysterious We were running into Tadminster now and Poirot directed the car to the,D
of middle age with keen eyes and the typical lawyer s mouth John introduced us both and explained the reason of our presence You will understand Wells he added that this is all strictly private We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind Quite so quite so said Mr Wells soothingly I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest but of course it s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor s certificate Yes I suppose so Clever man Bauerstein Great authority on,D
at his watch I wonder if we ve time to pick up Cynthia No she ll have started from the hospital by now Cynthia That s not your wife No Cynthia is a protégée of my mother s the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor He came a cropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless My mother came to the rescue and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster seven miles away As he spoke the last words we drew,D
but and this is significant I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing He looked at Mary Cavendish Am I right madame She bowed her head Quite right monsieur You understand that if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts I would have done so But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence In a sense that is correct madame But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions and left me free to see other facts in their true,D
Look after her Hastings will you Wells is waiting for me Oh here s Monsieur Poirot He s helping us you know Evie Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at John What do you mean helping us Helping us to investigate Nothing to investigate Have they taken him to prison yet Taken who to prison Who Alfred Inglethorp of course My dear Evie do be careful Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure More fool Lawrence retorted Miss Howard Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily as I always,D
came up to me rather mysteriously and asked if she might have a few words with me Certainly What is it Dorcas Well it s just this sir You ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to day perhaps I nodded Well sir you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress or anyone else had a green dress Yes yes You have found one My interest was aroused No not that sir But since then I ve remembered what the young gentlemen John and Lawrence were still the young gentlemen to Dorcas call the dressing up box It,D
me eagerly Mr Hastings you re honest I can trust you I was a little startled She laid her hand on my arm and sank her voice to a whisper Look after her Mr Hastings My poor Emily They re a lot of sharks all of them Oh I know what I m talking about There isn t one of them that s not hard up and trying to get money out of her I ve protected her as much as I could Now I m out of the way they ll impose upon her Of course Miss Howard I,D
The room was dimly lighted Dr Bauerstein is much of my height and build and like me wears a beard In the dim light and suffering as she was my poor wife mistook him for me Ah murmured Poirot to himself But it is an idea that You think it is true I whispered I do not say that But it is truly an ingenious supposition You read my wife s last words as an accusation Inglethorp was continuing they were on the contrary an appeal to me The Coroner reflected a moment then he said I believe Mr Inglethorp,D
carefully His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook We have found in this room he said writing busily six points of interest Shall I enumerate them or will you Oh you I replied hastily Very well then One a coffee cup that has been ground into powder two a despatch case with a key in the lock three a stain on the floor That may have been done some time ago I interrupted No for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee Four a fragment of some dark green fabric only a thread or two,D
he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself He wished to be arrested He would then produce his irreproachable alibi and hey presto he was safe for life But I still don t see how he managed to prove his alibi and yet go to the chemist s shop Poirot stared at me in surprise Is it possible My poor friend You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist s shop Miss Howard,D
them up again I suppose I said that as usual you are not going to explain On the contrary No 1 were the finger prints of Monsieur Lawrence No 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia They are not important I merely obtained them for comparison No 3 is a little more complicated Yes It is as you see highly magnified You may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture I will not describe to you the special apparatus dusting powder etc which I used It is a well known process to the police and by means,D
she called I ve just five minutes to catch the post Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing room Mary Cavendish brought our coffee to us She seemed excited Do you young people want lights or do you enjoy the twilight she asked Will you take Mrs Inglethorp her coffee Cynthia I will pour it out Do not trouble Mary said Inglethorp I will take it to Emily He poured it out and went out of the room carrying it carefully Lawrence followed him and Mrs Cavendish sat down by us We three sat,D
lock and passed it to me to inspect I saw nothing peculiar however It was an ordinary key of the Yale type with a bit of twisted wire through the handle Next he examined the framework of the door we had broken in assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot Then he went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia s room That door was also bolted as I had stated However he went to the length of unbolting it and opening and shutting it several times this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise,D
Analytical Chemist Poirot hopped down briskly and went inside In a few minutes he was back again There he said That is all my business What were you doing there I asked in lively curiosity I left something to be analysed Yes but what The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom But that has already been tested I cried stupefied Dr Bauerstein had it tested and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it I know Dr Bauerstein had it tested replied Poirot quietly Well then Well I have a fancy,D
no possible scandal could attach to him This attitude of his gave me furiously to think and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested _Eh bien _ from that moment I was equally determined that he should not be arrested Wait a minute I don t see why he wished to be arrested Because _mon ami_ it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence Aha but it was clever his idea Assuredly he is a man of method See here,D
Manning succeeded her and testified to witnessing a document Manning fixed the time at about four thirty William was of the opinion that it was rather earlier Cynthia Murdoch came next She had however little to tell She had known nothing of the tragedy until awakened by Mrs Cavendish You did not hear the table fall No I was fast asleep The Coroner smiled A good conscience makes a sound sleeper he observed Thank you Miss Murdoch that is all Miss Howard Miss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs Inglethorp on the evening of the 17th Poirot,D
Mrs Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard and of the latter s innuendoes I was hardly as clear as I could wish I repeated myself several times and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten Poirot smiled kindly on me The mind is confused Is it not so Take time _mon ami_ You are agitated you are excited it is but natural Presently when we are calmer we will arrange the facts neatly each in his proper place We will examine and reject Those of importance we will put on one side those of no importance pouf,D
that her father was a doctor Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam Anyway she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly Mrs Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders which she occasionally took at night What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs Inglethorp,D
barely a mile out of our way and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary Mrs Inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there and we could come back with Cynthia in the pony trap We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall She took us up to her sanctum and introduced us to her fellow dispenser a rather awe inspiring individual whom Cynthia cheerily addressed as Nibs,D
have guessed But it can t be so it s too monstrous too impossible It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp Poirot shook his head gravely Don t ask me about it continued Miss Howard because I shan t tell you I won t admit it even to myself I must be mad to think of such a thing Poirot nodded as if satisfied I will ask you nothing It is enough for me that it is as I thought And I I too have an instinct We are working together towards a common end Don t ask me to help you,D
you as peculiar about this box I examined it closely No I can t say that I do Look at the label I read the label carefully One powder to be taken at bedtime if required Mrs Inglethorp No I see nothing unusual Not the fact that there is no chemist s name Ah I exclaimed To be sure that is odd Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that without his printed name No I can t say that I have I was becoming quite excited but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking Yet,D
for some time in silence It was a glorious night hot and still Mrs Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf It s almost too hot she murmured We shall have a thunderstorm Alas that these harmonious moments can never endure My paradise was rudely shattered by the sound of a well known and heartily disliked voice in the hall Dr Bauerstein exclaimed Cynthia What a funny time to come I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish but she seemed quite undisturbed the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary In a few moments Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the,D
strenuously denied it at the inquest it must be either Lawrence or John Now if it was Lawrence Mary Cavendish s conduct was just as inexplicable But if on the other hand it was John the whole thing was explained quite naturally So I cried a light breaking in upon me it was John who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon Exactly And you have known this all along Certainly Mrs Cavendish s behaviour could only be explained that way And yet you say he may be acquitted Poirot shrugged his shoulders Certainly I do At the police court proceedings,D
each in turn as he did so His physiognomy underwent a curious change An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled and half relieved _Bien _ he said at last It is evident I had an idea but clearly I was mistaken Yes altogether I was mistaken Yet it is strange But no matter And with a characteristic shrug he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley but,D
appeared to be in an absolute frenzy My dear Poirot I expostulated I never thought it would interest you I didn t know it was of any importance Importance It is of the first importance So Dr Bauerstein was here on Tuesday night the night of the murder Hastings do you not see That alters everything everything I had never seen him so upset Loosening his hold of me he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks still murmuring to himself Yes that alters everything everything Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision _Allons _ he said We must act,D

taken into account A groan burst from Poirot What have I always told you Everything must be taken into account If the fact will not fit the theory let the theory go Well we shall see I said nettled Yes we shall see We had reached Leastways Cottage and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot My momentary annoyance vanished Poirot had placed our two chairs in,D
more lying rumours should be started Between you and me sir remarked Japp I d sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same And if it hadn t been for Mr Poirot here arrested you would have been as sure as eggs is eggs I was foolish no doubt murmured Inglethorp But you do not know inspector how I have been persecuted and maligned And he shot a baleful glance at Evelyn Howard Now sir said Japp turning briskly to John I should like,D
and she takes its secret with her to her grave Cavendish I much fear there is no coincidence there Monsieur Poirot I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive Suggestive or not interrupted John we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter But for him we should never have known of this will I suppose I may not ask you monsieur what first led you to suspect the fact Poirot smiled and answered A scribbled over old envelope and a freshly planted bed of begonias John I think would have pressed his,D
time Yes I understand continued the Coroner deliberately that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir That is so is it not This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot I fancied that it was news to him as well There was the faintest pause the mere hesitation of a moment before she answered Yes that is so And the boudoir window was open was it not Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered Yes Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside especially as,D

with you I m sure Cynthia hesitated a moment plucking up the grass with her tiny hands Then she said Mrs Cavendish does She hates me Hates you I cried astonished Cynthia nodded Yes I don t know why but she can t bear me and _he_ can t either There I know you re wrong I said warmly On the contrary John is very fond of you Oh yes _John_ I meant Lawrence Not of course that I care whether Lawrence hates me or not Still it s rather horrid when no one loves you isn t it But,D
framework of the door was solid and for a long time it resisted our efforts but at last we felt it give beneath our weight and finally with a resounding crash it was burst open We stumbled in together Lawrence still holding his candle Mrs Inglethorp was lying on the bed her whole form agitated by violent convulsions in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her As we entered however her limbs relaxed and she fell back upon the pillows John strode across the room and lit the gas Turning to Annie one of the housemaids,D
Poirot know but I lack the last link in my chain And unless I can find that missing link He shook his head gravely When did you first suspect John Cavendish I asked after a minute or two Did you not suspect him at all No indeed Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs Cavendish and her mother in law and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest No Did you not put two and two together and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife and you remember he,D
the explanation is quite simple So do not intrigue yourself my friend An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie so I had no time to reply Annie was a fine strapping girl and was evidently labouring under intense excitement mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy Poirot came to the point at once with a business like briskness I sent for you Annie because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters Mrs Inglethorp wrote last night How many were there And can you tell me any of the names and addresses,D
his head Why should she She had bolted the door leading into his room a most unusual proceeding on her part she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon No he was the last person she would admit But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs Inglethorp herself There is another possibility She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed and have got up later towards morning and bolted it then Poirot is that seriously your opinion No I do not say,D
you have been so vehement against Mr Inglethorp It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct which tells you another name No no no cried Miss Howard wildly flinging up her hands Don t say it Oh don t say it It isn t true It can t be true I don t know what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head I am right am I not asked Poirot Yes yes you must be a wizard to,D
impassive and wooden He started slightly as the damning words fell from the young man s lips I half thought he was going to rise from his chair but he remained seated although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his face You are sure of what you say asked the Coroner sternly Quite sure sir Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner s frown Oh no sir of course not But seeing it was Mr Inglethorp of the Hall I thought there was,D
after hesitating a moment pounded vigorously at the door A little minute cried Poirot from the window I come Motioning to me to follow him he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door Mr Mace began at once Oh Mr Poirot I m sorry for the inconvenience but I heard that you d just come back from the Hall Yes we have The young man moistened his dry lips His face was working curiously It s all over the village about old Mrs Inglethorp dying so suddenly They do say he lowered his voice cautiously that it s,D
general confusion the boudoir had not been swept that morning and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth The weather had been perfectly fine for some days and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit I strolled to the window and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir and also I learnt from you that they _had_ been planted yesterday afternoon I was now sure that one or possibly both of the gardeners,D
Mary Cavendish could be a murderess Yet beautiful women had been known to poison And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman s weapon How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday evening Had Mrs Inglethorp discovered something between her and Bauerstein and threatened to tell her husband Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and Evelyn Howard Was this what they had meant,D
he were arrested he probably would speak but I do not want it to come to that I must make him see the gravity of his position There is of course something discreditable behind his silence If he did not murder his wife he is nevertheless a scoundrel and has something of his own to conceal quite apart from the murder What can it be I mused won over to Poirot s views for the moment although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one Can you not guess asked Poirot smiling No can you,D
compromising items in her possession No suspicion attaches to her No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house She hides the strychnine and glasses in John s room She puts the beard in the attic She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered I don t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John I remarked It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to Lawrence Yes but that was mere chance All the evidence against him arose out of pure accident It,D

live here but I shall not You are going to leave him Yes But why She paused a long time and said at last Perhaps because I want to be free And as she spoke I had a sudden vision of broad spaces virgin tracts of forests untrodden lands and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish I seemed to see her for a moment as she was a proud wild creature as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills A little cry broke from her lips You don t,D

_mon ami_ Hastings Poirot I exclaimed I turned to the pony trap This is a very pleasant meeting for me Miss Cynthia This is my old friend Monsieur Poirot whom I have not seen for years Oh we know Monsieur Poirot said Cynthia gaily But I had no idea he was a friend of yours Yes indeed said Poirot seriously I know Mademoiselle Cynthia It is by the charity of that good Mrs Inglethorp that I am here Then as I looked at him inquiringly Yes my friend she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who alas,D
front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant It was going to be a hot day Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary a curious mingling of terror and agitation Look Poirot I said He leant forward _Tiens _ he said It is Mr Mace from the chemist s shop He is coming here The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage and,D
was Mr Inglethorp s voice you heard Oh yes sir whose else s could it be Well what happened next Later I came back to the hall but it was all quiet At five o clock Mrs Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea nothing to eat to the boudoir She was looking dreadful so white and upset Dorcas she says I ve had a great shock I m sorry for that m m I says You ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea m m She had something in,D
the time of her death and for some time before it was taking a tonic containing strychnine Ah said the Coroner The jury looked up interested I believe continued Lawrence that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug administered for some time has ended by causing death Also is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death We are much obliged to you Mr Cavendish Dr Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed,D
Well tell him to look us up to morrow morning will you Certainly monsieur But on the following day no sign of Poirot I was getting angry He was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion After lunch Lawrence drew me aside and asked if I was going down to see him No I don t think I shall He can come up here if he wants to see us Oh Lawrence looked indeterminate Something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity What is it I asked I could go if there s anything special It,D
course The blackguard I cried indignantly Not at all He is on the contrary a patriot Think what he stands to lose I admire the man myself But I could not look at it in Poirot s philosophical way And this is the man with whom Mrs Cavendish has been wandering about all over the country I cried indignantly Yes I should fancy he had found her very useful remarked Poirot So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together any other vagaries of the doctor s passed unobserved Then you think he never really cared for her,D
and Miss Howard were in custody Now at last I had Poirot to myself and could relieve my still burning curiosity Poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said I did not deceive you _mon ami_ At most I permitted you to deceive yourself Yes but why Well it is difficult to explain You see my friend you have a nature so honest and a countenance so transparent that _enfin_ to conceal your feelings is impossible If I had told you my ideas the very first time you saw Mr Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman,D
how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck The Coroner went straight to the point On Monday evening last did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness No I did not There is no dog at Styles except an outdoor sheepdog which is in perfect health You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on Monday last I do Do you also deny _this_ The Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was inscribed Certainly I do The hand writing is quite different from mine I will,D
and uses glasses Poirot I cannot believe you are serious I am absolutely serious my friend But this is childish No it is very momentous And supposing the Coroner s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp What becomes of your theories then They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake But that will not occur For one thing a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself and Mr Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire Also he added placidly _I_ should not allow it,D
Miss Howard here Mademoiselle Cynthia Monsieur Lawrence The good Dorcas And Annie _Bien _ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until Mr Inglethorp arrives I have sent him a note Miss Howard rose immediately from her seat If that man comes into the house I leave it No no Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair A few minutes later Alfred Inglethorp entered the room The company once assembled Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a popular lecturer and bowed politely to,D
who could swear that Mrs Inglethorp was carrying her coffee as yet untasted in her hand My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr Bauerstein It seemed to me the man would never go He rose at last however and I breathed a sigh of relief I ll walk down to the village with you said Mr Inglethorp I must see our agent over those estate accounts He turned to John No one need sit up I will take the latch key CHAPTER III THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY To make this part of my story,D

you suspected him as long ago as that Yes To begin with whoever else might benefit by Mrs Inglethorp s death her husband would benefit the most There was no getting away from that When I went up to Styles with you that first day I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed but from what I knew of Mr Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it When I arrived at the château I realized at once that it was Mrs Inglethorp who had burnt the,D
said Poirot genially I suppose Mr Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs when he was Shah of Persia He did have a beard sir replied Dorcas smiling And well I know it for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with And I m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance I didn t know as there was a beard up there at all It must have been got quite lately I think There was a red wig I know but nothing else in the way of hair Burnt corks they,D

been acting with her in the tableaux The following morning Mrs Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast as she was rather overtired but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12 30 and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party Such a charming invitation from Mrs Rolleston Lady Tadminster s sister you know The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror one of our oldest families Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr Bauerstein We had a pleasant luncheon and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster which was,D
the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not And I am pleased with you You have a good memory and you have given me the facts faithfully Of the order in which you present them I say nothing truly it is deplorable But I make allowances you are upset To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance What is that I asked You have not told me if Mrs Inglethorp ate well last night I stared at him Surely the war had affected the little man s brain,D
Now I am ready We will proceed to the château and study matters on the spot Excuse me _mon ami_ you dressed in haste and your tie is on one side Permit me With a deft gesture he rearranged it _Ça y est _ Now shall we start We hurried up the village and turned in at the lodge gates Poirot stopped for a moment and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park still glittering with morning dew So beautiful so beautiful and yet the poor family plunged in sorrow prostrated with grief He looked at me keenly as,D
not been slept in and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied We went straight to the connecting door That too was locked or bolted on the inside What was to be done Oh dear sir cried Dorcas wringing her hands what ever shall we do We must try and break the door in I suppose It ll be a tough job though Here let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him to go for Dr Wilkins at once Now then we ll have a try at the door Half a,D
must in fact have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers His manner was unfortunate I observed thoughtfully Yes You realize of course what was at the back of that No You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of the crime No I exclaimed astonished Impossible Not at all I myself nearly had the same idea It was in my mind when I asked Mr Wells that first question about the will Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up and her clever male impersonations as Dorcas recounted them to us There was,D
and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir the door of which she shut behind her As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later I had to pass the open boudoir window and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself Then you won t show it to me To which Mrs Inglethorp replied My dear Mary it has nothing to do with that matter Then show it to me I tell you it is,D
they do Cynthia dear I said earnestly I m sure you are mistaken Look there is John and Miss Howard Cynthia nodded rather gloomily Yes John likes me I think and of course Evie for all her gruff ways wouldn t be unkind to a fly But Lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it and Mary can hardly bring herself to be civil to me She wants Evie to stay on is begging her to but she doesn t want me and and I don t know what to do Suddenly the poor child burst out crying,D
phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him to Mr Inglethorp Pressed he admitted that he only knew Mr Inglethorp by sight He had never spoken to him The witness was not cross examined Alfred Inglethorp was called and denied having purchased the poison He also denied having quarrelled with his wife Various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements The gardeners evidence as to the witnessing of the will was taken and then Dorcas was called Dorcas faithful to her young gentlemen denied strenuously that it could have been John s voice she heard and resolutely,D
s a bad lot What did she say Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace Darling Alfred dearest Alfred wicked calumnies wicked lies wicked woman to accuse her dear husband The sooner I left her house the better So I m off But not now This minute For a moment we sat and stared at her Finally John Cavendish finding his persuasions of no avail went off to look up the trains His wife followed him murmuring something about persuading Mrs Inglethorp to think better of it As she left the room Miss Howard s face changed She leant towards,D
You devil How did you get it A chair was overturned Poirot skipped nimbly aside A quick movement on his part and his assailant fell with a crash _Messieurs mesdames_ said Poirot with a flourish let me introduce you to the murderer Mr Alfred Inglethorp CHAPTER XIII POIROT EXPLAINS Poirot you old villain I said I ve half a mind to strangle you What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done We were sitting in the library Several hectic days lay behind us In the room below John and Mary were together once more while Alfred Inglethorp,D
most plausible stories Far more convincing than Mr Inglethorp s stony denials I could not help laughing My dear Poirot I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy But seriously in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp s innocence Why not now as much as before Nothing has changed But the evidence is so conclusive Yes too conclusive We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage and proceeded up the now familiar stairs Yes yes too conclusive continued Poirot almost to himself,D
And subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide was quite unthinkable Mr Philips sat down and wiped his forehead The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest the medical evidence being again taken first Sir Ernest Heavywether who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses only asked two questions I take it Dr Bauerstein that strychnine as a drug acts quickly Yes And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case Yes Thank you Mr Mace identified the,D

and the adjoining one occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance Nor did they recognize it for what it was a piece torn from a green land armlet There was a little stir of excitement Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land Mrs Cavendish Therefore it must have been Mrs Cavendish who entered the deceased s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle Cynthia s room But that door was bolted on the inside I cried When I examined the room,D
use mostly though tis messy getting it off again Miss Cynthia was a nigger once and oh the trouble she had So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard said Poirot thoughtfully as we walked out into the hall again Do you think it is _the_ one I whispered eagerly Poirot nodded I do You notice it had been trimmed No Yes It was cut exactly the shape of Mr Inglethorp s and I found one or two snipped hairs Hastings this affair is very deep Who put it in the chest I wonder Someone with a good deal of,D
really in the chemist s shop in Styles St Mary where you purchased strychnine in the name of Alfred Inglethorp No that is a lie I put it to you that wearing a suit of Mr Inglethorp s clothes with a black beard trimmed to resemble his you were there and signed the register in his name That is absolutely untrue Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand writing between the note the register and your own to the consideration of the jury said Mr Philips and sat down with the air of a man who has done,D
on Tuesday morning With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy Poirot led the way back to the morning room See you one should not ask for outside proof no reason should be enough But the flesh is weak it is consolation to find that one is on the right track Ah my friend I am like a giant refreshed I run I leap And in very truth run and leap he did gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window What is your remarkable little friend doing asked a voice behind me and I turned to find,D
s questions he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist but had only recently come to this particular shop as the assistant formerly there had just been called up for the army These preliminaries completed the Coroner proceeded to business Mr Mace have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person Yes sir When was this Last Monday night Monday Not Tuesday No sir Monday the 16th Will you tell us to whom you sold it You could have heard a pin drop Yes sir It was to Mr Inglethorp Every eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,D
strange and probably utterly impossible idea And yet it fits in I shrugged my shoulders I privately thought that Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas In this case surely the truth was only too plain and apparent So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box I remarked Very simple as you said I really wonder that I did not think of it myself Poirot did not appear to be listening to me They have made one more discovery _là bas_ he observed jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of,D
destroy the will as she was before to make it What was that something As far as we know she was quite alone during that half hour Nobody entered or left that boudoir What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment One can only guess but I believe my guess to be correct Mrs Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk We know this because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband s desk locked She was anxious to find some stamps and according to my theory she,D
was to destroy some important document possibly a will So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me I did not of course know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon and I will admit that when I learnt that fact I fell into a grievous error I came to the conclusion that Mrs Inglethorp s determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon and that therefore the quarrel took place after and not before the making of,D
they were raised in anger In fact they would be more audible where you were than in the hall Possibly Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel I really do not remember hearing anything Do you mean to say you did not hear voices Oh yes I heard the voices but I did not hear what they said A faint spot of colour came into her cheek I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations The Coroner persisted And you remember nothing at all _Nothing_ Mrs Cavendish Not one stray word or phrase,D
that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence Quickly he forces the lock with a penknife and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for But now a fresh dilemma arises he dare not keep that piece of paper on him He may be seen leaving the room he may be searched If the paper is found on him it is certain doom Probably at this minute too he hears the sounds below of Mr Wells and John leaving the boudoir He must act quickly Where can he hide this,D
paper I mused Not at all The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes I have kept them there myself Neatly arranged there is nothing to offend the eye Poirot I asked earnestly have you made up your mind about this crime Yes that is to say I believe I know how it was committed Ah Unfortunately I have no proof beyond my surmise unless With sudden energy he caught me by the arm and whirled me down the hall calling out in French in his excitement Mademoiselle Dorcas Mademoiselle Dorcas _un moment,D
would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease Yes that s possible admitted John Still he added I m blest if I can see what his motive could have been I trembled Look here I said I may be altogether wrong And remember all this is in confidence Oh of course that goes without saying We had walked as we talked and now we passed through the little gate into the garden Voices rose near at hand for tea was spread out under the sycamore tree as it had been,D
you Yes The truth is I ve got a message for you from Poirot Yes He told me to wait until I was alone with you I said dropping my voice significantly and watching him intently out of the corner of my eye I have always been rather good at what is called I believe creating an atmosphere Well There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face Had he any idea of what I was about to say This is the message I dropped my voice still lower Find the extra coffee cup and you can rest,D
in his turn introduced us both to his companion Superintendent Summerhaye I need hardly ask what you are doing here gentlemen remarked Poirot Japp closed one eye knowingly No indeed Pretty clear case I should say But Poirot answered gravely There I differ from you Oh come said Summerhaye opening his lips for the first time Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight The man s caught red handed How he could be such a fool beats me But Japp was looking attentively at Poirot Hold your fire Summerhaye he remarked jocularly Me and Moosier here have met before,D
a Herculean task and I did not envy John I could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position For the moment he sought refuge in retreat and left the room precipitately Dorcas brought in fresh tea As she left the room Poirot came over from the window where he had been standing and sat down facing Miss Howard Mademoiselle he said gravely I want to ask you something Ask away said the lady eyeing him with some disfavour I want to be able to count upon your help I ll help,D
we are right If we are right Miss Howard on whose side are you then I don t know I don t know Come now It could be hushed up There must be no hushing up But Emily herself She broke off Miss Howard said Poirot gravely this is unworthy of you Suddenly she took her face from her hands Yes she said quietly that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke She flung her head up proudly _This_ is Evelyn Howard And she is on the side of Justice Let the cost be what it may And with these words,D
that he said I always had hopes of that letter But no it was not to be This affair must all be unravelled from within He tapped his forehead These little grey cells It is up to them as you say over here Then suddenly he asked Are you a judge of finger marks my friend No I said rather surprised I know that there are no two finger marks alike but that s as far as my science goes Exactly He unlocked a little drawer and took out some photographs which he laid on the table I have numbered,D
Sherlock Holmes by all means But really seriously I am awfully drawn to it I came across a man in Belgium once a very famous detective and he quite inflamed me He was a marvellous little fellow He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method My system is based on his though of course I have progressed rather further He was a funny little man a great dandy but wonderfully clever Like a good detective story myself remarked Miss Howard Lots of nonsense written though Criminal discovered in last chapter Everyone dumbfounded Real,D
But certainly Who else It was most easy for her She is of a good height her voice is deep and manly moreover remember she and Inglethorp are cousins and there is a distinct resemblance between them especially in their gait and bearing It was simplicity itself They are a clever pair I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done I remarked _Bon _ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair You remember her once mentioning,D

Dear Madman when he happened to write Antony decided to stroll over to the Red House after lunch and call upon his friend Having inspected his bedroom which was not quite the lavender smelling country inn bedroom of fiction but sufficiently clean and comfortable he set out over the fields As he came down the drive and approached the old red brick front of the house there was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower borders a gentle cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms and from distant lawns the whir of a mowing machine that most,E
all the other things which had made up his world lately This was the real thing This was life Well he began deliberately the whole point is that I know Mark Now Mark But Antony was off the seat and letting himself gently down into the ditch His intention was to crawl round it until the shed came in sight The footsteps which he had heard seemed to be underneath the shed probably there was a trap door of some kind in the floor Whoever it was would have heard their voices and would probably think it worth while to,E
to consider whether he would have run away if he had been guiltless of his brother s death No doubt innocent people lost their heads sometimes It was possible that if it were proved afterwards that Mark Ablett had shot his brother it might also be proved that he was justified in so doing and that when he ran away from his brother s corpse he had really nothing to fear at the hands of the Law In this connection he need hardly remind the jury that they were not the final tribunal and that if they found Mark Ablett,E
doesn t matter does it It has nothing to do with Robert Hasn t it I say _has_ it said Bill getting excited again I don t know We don t know what has or what hasn t But it _has_ got something to do with Miss Norris And Miss Norris He broke off suddenly What about her Well you re all in it in a kind of way And if something unaccountable happens to one of you a day or two before something unaccountable happens to the whole house one is well interested It was a good enough reason,E

on the wall They were outside on the lawn again now Bill and Antony and Bill was listening open mouthed to his friend s theory of yesterday s happenings It fitted in it explained things but it did not get them any further It only gave them another mystery to solve What s that said Antony Mark Where s Mark If he never went into the office at all then where is he now I don t say that he never went into the office In fact he must have gone Elsie heard him He stopped and repeated slowly She,E
there Antony felt in the bag Stones and yes there s something else He took it out and held it up There we are Bill It was the office key By Jove you were right Antony felt in the bag again and then turned it gently upside down on the grass A dozen large stones fell out and something else He flashed down his torch Another key he said He put the two keys in his pocket and sat there for a long time in silence thinking Bill was silent too not liking to interrupt his thoughts but at last,E
Cayley knowing Well that wants thinking over It s going to be difficult I wish we were sleeping at the inn Is this Miss Norbury by any chance Bill looked up quickly They were close to Jallands now an old thatched farmhouse which after centuries of sleep had woken up to a new world and had forthwith sprouted wings wings however of so discreet a growth that they had not brought with them any obvious change of character and Jallands even with a bathroom was still Jallands To the outward view at any rate Inside it was more clearly Mrs,E
were looking for in the cupboard said Bill eagerly Of course Why no collar I said For some reason Cayley considered it necessary to hide all Mark s clothes not just the suit but everything which he was wearing or supposed to be wearing at the time of the murder But he hadn t hidden the collar Why Had he left it out by mistake So I looked in the cupboard It wasn t there Had he left it out on purpose If so why and where was it Naturally I began to say to myself Where have I seen,E
like said Antony Cold Well here s luck to it He gave a sudden kick flashed for a moment in the water and was gone Antony steadied the boat and took another look at his landmarks Bill came up behind him with a loud explosion It s pretty muddy he protested Weeds No thank the Lord Well try again Bill gave another kick and disappeared Again Antony coaxed the boat back into position and again Bill popped up this time in front of him I feel that if I threw you a sardine said Antony with a smile you d,E
t let myself think that not yet anyway It s too horrible CHAPTER XII A Shadow on the Wall In the twenty hours or so at his disposal Inspector Birch had been busy He had telegraphed to London a complete description of Mark in the brown flannel suit which he had last been seen wearing he had made inquiries at Stanton as to whether anybody answering to this description had been seen leaving by the 4 20 and though the evidence which had been volunteered to him had been inconclusive it made it possible that Mark had indeed caught that,E
didn t see anything Nor what Antony was silent for a moment I didn t see anything Bill Or rather I did see something I saw a door in the wall a cupboard And it s locked So if there s anything we want to find that s where it is Could Mark be hiding there I called through the keyhole in a whisper Mark are you there he would have thought it was Cayley There was no answer Well let s go down and try again We might be able to get the door open Antony shook his head,E
s have Cayley s character Cayley from within Bill laughed in pleased embarrassment and protested that he was not a blooming novelist Besides he added Mark s easy Cayley s one of these heavy quiet people who might be thinking about anything Mark gives himself away Ugly black jawed devil isn t he Some women like that type of ugliness Yes that s true Between ourselves I think there s one here who does Rather a pretty girl at Jallands he waved his left hand down that way What s Jallands Well I suppose it used to be a farm,E
he had hesitated to define his position that morning in regard to Mark he did not hesitate to place himself on the side of the Law against Cayley Mark after all had done him no harm but Cayley had committed an unforgivable offence Cayley had listened secretly to a private conversation between himself and Tony Let Cayley hang if the Law demanded it Antony looked at his watch and stood up Come along he said It s time for that job I spoke about The passage said Bill eagerly No the thing which I said that I had to do,E
even you may call it murder but by that time I shall be out of the way Let them call it what they like I must begin by taking you back to a summer day fifteen years ago when I was a boy of thirteen and Mark a young man of twenty five His whole life was make believe and just now he was pretending to be a philanthropist He sat in our little drawing room flicking his gloves against the back of his left hand and my mother good soul thought what a noble young gentleman he was and,E
say but apparently finding plenty and Miss Norris crowding so much into one despairing gesture that Cayley s unvarying Thank you very much might have been taken this time as gratitude for an artistic entertainment Bill had seen them into the car had taken his own farewells with a special squeeze of the hand for Betty and had wandered out to join Antony on his garden seat Well this is a rum show said Bill as he sat down Very rum William And you actually walked right into it Right into it said Antony Then you re the man I,E
his head with a smile I think I will if you don t mind very much Bill Just in case In case of what Well in case Bill had to be content with that but he was too much excited to wonder what Antony meant Righto he said Go on Well we ll just make sure we can get back again first It really wouldn t be fair on the Inspector if we got stuck down here for the rest of our lives He s got enough to do trying to find Mark but if he has to find you,E
down to the village They aren t finding anything at the pond are they No But they like doing it Something off their minds when they can say they ve done it Bill deep in his book looked up and said Yes and went back to it again He was just getting to the place What s the book said Cayley coming up to him Out of the corner of his eye he glanced at the shelf of sermons as he came Bill saw that glance and wondered Was there anything there to give away the secret I was just,E
makes it more interesting Cayley said nothing Bill chewed a piece of grass and then said Does it make much difference It makes it more hard to understand what happened in there Take your accidental theory and see where you get to No instinctive turning of the key now is there He s got to open the door to get it and opening the door means showing his head to anybody in the hall his cousin for instance whom he left there two minutes ago Is a man in Mark s state of mind frightened to death lest he should,E
out Then struck by an idea he turned back to Antony and said Do you think I had better go up to the pond to make sure that they re still at it Because He broke off suddenly at the sight of Antony s face Oh idiot idiot Antony cried Oh most super excellent of Watsons Oh you lamb you blessing Oh Gillingham you incomparable ass What on earth The window the window cried Antony pointing to it Bill turned back to the window expecting it to say something As it said nothing he looked at Antony again He was,E
us up and see that we re nice and comfortable Yes that s awkward said Bill But we could lock our doors and then he wouldn t know that we weren t there Have you ever locked your door Never No And you can bet that Cayley knows that Anyway he d bang on it and you wouldn t answer and then what would he think Bill was silent crushed Then I don t see how we re going to do it he said after deep thought He ll obviously come to us just before he starts out and that,E

will look There s a better place than that What Somewhere where everybody has already looked By Jove You mean that as soon as the pond _has_ been dragged Cayley will hide something there Yes I m afraid so But why afraid Because I think that it must be something very important something which couldn t easily be hidden anywhere else What asked Bill eagerly Antony shook his head No I m not going to talk about it yet We can wait and see what the Inspector finds He may find something I don t know what something that Cayley,E
what Antony would say to it and the possible depth of the water and of the mud at the bottom and was still so wondering and saying Good Lord what a life to himself when Antony reappeared Bill got up and came down the slope to meet him Six he said firmly Sixth post from the end Good smiled Antony Mine was the eighteenth a little way past it What did you go off for To see Cayley into bed Is it all right Yes Better hang your coat over the sixth post and then we shall see it more,E
ponds but the question was did Cayleys like having them dragged Was Cayley anxious about it or quite indifferent He certainly did not seem to be anxious but he could hide his feelings very easily beneath that heavy solid face and it was not often that the real Cayley peeped out Just a little too eager once or twice perhaps but there was nothing to be learnt from it this morning Perhaps he knew that the pond had no secrets to give up After all inspectors were always dragging ponds Bill came in noisily Bill s face was an open,E
guilty of murder it would not prejudice his trial in any way if and when he was apprehended The jury could consider their verdict They considered it They announced that the deceased had died as the result of a bullet wound and that the bullet had been fired by his brother Mark Ablett Bill turned round to Antony at his side But Antony was gone Across the room he saw Andrew Amos and Parsons going out of the door together and Antony was between them CHAPTER XX Mr Beverley is Tactful The inquest had been held at the Lamb at,E
That s just what I told Mr Cayley when he called my attention to the pond However we shan t do any harm by looking It s the unexpected that s the most likely in this sort of case You re quite right Inspector Well we mustn t keep you Good afternoon and Antony smiled pleasantly at him Good afternoon sir Good afternoon said Bill Antony stood looking after the Inspector as he strode off silent for so long that Bill shook him by the arm at last and asked him rather crossly what was the matter Antony shook his,E
grammar school and into a London office and discovered there that there was not much fun to be got in this world on two pounds a week I had a frantic letter from him one day saying that he must have a hundred at once or he would be ruined and I went to Mark for the money Only to borrow it you understand he gave me a good salary and I could have paid it back in three months But no He saw nothing for himself in it I suppose no applause no admiration Philip s gratitude would be,E
am not suggesting that there was anything sinister about the passage in the first place It was just a little private bit of romance and adventure for Mark three days ago He didn t even know that Robert was coming But somehow the passage has been used since in connection with Robert Perhaps Mark escaped that way perhaps he s hiding there now And if so then the only person who could give him away was Miss Norris And she of course would only do it innocently not knowing that the passage had anything to do with it So it,E
to the jury Inspector Birch so he told the world had arrived at the Red House at 4 42 p m on the afternoon in question He had been received by Mr Matthew Cayley who had made a short statement to him and he had then proceeded to examine the scene of the crime The French windows had been forced from outside The door leading into the hall was locked he had searched the room thoroughly and had found no trace of a key In the bedroom leading out of the office he had found an open window There were,E
and not the other way round Oh said Bill rather upset Yes He thought for a moment All right Say that Cayley has gone into the room first and seen Robert on the ground Well Well there you are And what does he say to Mark That it s a fine afternoon and could he lend him a pocket handkerchief Or does he ask him what s happened Well of course I suppose he asks what happened said Bill reluctantly And what does Mark say Explains that the revolver went off accidentally during a struggle Whereupon Cayley shields him by,E
stairs rooms are always outside the doors Sometimes they are no doubt but I think we shall probably find that these are inside Oh well of course if they are inside then your original theory is probably the correct one Having often seen them outside I just wondered that s all You asked me to be quite frank you know and tell you what I thought But no doubt you re right and we shall find them inside as you say Even if the key was outside went on Cayley stubbornly I still think it might have been accidental He,E
Bill You re ready to go Quite said Bill surprised You re quite ready for what we may find You re being dashed mysterious old boy I know I am He gave a little laugh and went on Perhaps I m being an ass just a melodramatic ass Well I hope I am He looked at his watch It s safe is it They re still busy at the pond We d better make certain Could you be a sleuthhound Bill one of those that travel on their stomachs very noiselessly I mean could you get near enough to the,E
idea of not letting the body be found he d have put big stones in his pockets and the only big stones are near the water s edge and they would have left marks and they haven t and therefore he didn t and oh bother the pond that can wait till this afternoon Bill where does the secret passage begin Well that s what we ve got to find out isn t it Yes You see my idea is this He explained his reasons for thinking that the secret of the passage was concerned in some way with the,E
off early next morning Did he describe her Yes She was middlin Middlin tall middlin age middlin colour and so on Doesn t help much does it But still a woman Does that upset your theory Antony shook his head No Bill not at all he said You knew all the time At least you guessed Wait till to morrow I ll tell you everything to morrow To morrow said Bill in great disappointment Well I ll tell you one thing to night if you ll promise not to ask any more questions But you probably know it already What,E
put him on to it Cayley obviously wanted as many people as possible to know about Robert Are you going to tell the police Yes I suppose they ll have to know Cayley may have left another confession I hope he won t give me away you see I ve been a sort of accessory since yesterday evening And I must go and see Miss Norbury I asked explained Bill because I was wondering what I should say to to Betty Miss Calladine You see she s bound to ask Perhaps you won t see her again for a long,E
the next hour or so and that he would be alone in the house to do what he liked about it And as I expected he couldn t resist it He altered the keys and gave himself away entirely But the library key was still outside Why didn t he alter that Because he s a clever devil For one thing the Inspector had been in the library and might possibly have noticed it already And for another Antony hesitated What said Bill after waiting for him to go on It s only guesswork But I fancy that Cayley was,E
shadow on the wall Oh ass and ten times ass Bill looked uncomprehendingly at him Antony took his arm and pointed to the wall of the passage Look at the sunlight on it he said That s because you ve left the door of that room open The sun comes straight in through the windows Now I m going to shut the door Look D you see how the shadow moves across That s what I saw the shadow moving across as the door shut behind him Bill go in and shut the door behind you quite naturally Quick Bill,E
middle of the pond He had stopped The oars rested on the water He picked up the bag from between his feet leant over the nose of the boat and rested it lightly on the water for a moment Then he let go It sank slowly He waited there watching afraid perhaps that it might rise again Antony began to count And now Cayley was back at his starting place He tied up the boat looked carefully round to see that he had left no traces behind him and then turned to the water again For a long time as,E
looked back unwaveringly and said nothing I think said the Major gently leaning over to Mrs Calladine that it would be better if you took Betty back to London to night Very well she agreed quietly You will come with us Ruth I ll see you safely there said Bill in a meek voice He didn t quite know what was happening and having expected to stay at the Red House for another week he had nowhere to go to in London but London seemed to be the place that everyone was going to and when he could get Tony,E
rather a score for me if they _had_ all been outside He had finished his writing and now passed the paper over to Bill In the clear moonlight the carefully printed letters could easily be read GO ON TALKING AS IF I WERE HERE AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO TURN ROUND AS IF I WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS BEHIND YOU BUT GO ON TALKING I know you don t agree with me Antony went on as Bill read but you ll see that I m right Bill looked up and nodded eagerly He had forgotten golf and Betty and,E
53 p m that afternoon and this man caught the 3 55 up train to town There was a pond in the grounds of the Red House He had dragged this but without result Antony listened to him carelessly thinking his own thoughts all the time Medical evidence followed but there was nothing to be got from that He felt so close to the truth at any moment something might give his brain the one little hint which it wanted Inspector Birch was just pursuing the ordinary Whatever else this case was it was not ordinary There was something uncanny,E
murderer if you like I shall not mind now Our plans were settled I went to London on the Monday and wrote him a letter from Robert The artistic touch again I also bought a revolver On the Tuesday morning he announced the arrival of Robert at the breakfast table Robert was now alive we had six witnesses to prove it six witnesses who knew that he was coming that afternoon Our private plan was that Robert should present himself at three o clock in readiness for the return of the golfing party shortly afterwards The maid would go to,E
Mark change his clothes so secretly Disguise But then what about his face That was much more important than clothes His face his beard he d have to shave off his beard and then oh idiot I saw you looking at that poster Mark acting Mark made up Mark disguised Oh priceless idiot Mark was Robert Matches please Bill passed over the matches again waited till Antony had relit his pipe and then held out his hand for them just as they were going into the other s pocket Yes said Bill thoughtfully Yes But wait a moment What about,E
but that I understand it And I think that Mark s dead body is in the passage now and has been there since say half past two yesterday afternoon And to night Cayley is going to hide it in the pond Bill pulled at the moss on the ground beside him threw away a handful or two and said slowly You may be right but it s all guess work you know Antony laughed Good Lord of course it is he said And to night we shall know if it s a good guess or a bad one Bill brightened,E
been meant as a hint to any too curious guest not to ask more questions or a reminder to his host not to talk too freely in front of strangers although he gave it the sound of a mere statement of fact But the subject dropped to be succeeded by the more fascinating one of the coming foursome Mrs Calladine was driving over with the players in order to lunch with an old friend who lived near the links and Mark and Cayley were remaining at home on affairs Apparently affairs were now to include a prodigal brother But that,E
get an obstreperous Robert out of the house Well he sits there for a moment and then goes into the library Why not He is still within reach if wanted Suddenly he hears a pistol shot A pistol shot is the last noise you expect to hear in a country house very natural then that for the moment he would hardly realize what it was He listens and hears nothing more Perhaps it wasn t a pistol shot after all After a moment or two he goes to the library door again The profound silence makes him uneasy now _Was_,E
at all we must assume that it doesn t begin there Oh I see Bill chewed a piece of grass thoughtfully Anyhow it wouldn t begin on an upstairs floor would it Probably not Well we re getting on You can wash out the kitchen and all that part of the house said Bill after more thought We can t go there Right And the cellars if there are any Well that doesn t leave us much No Of course it s only a hundred to one chance that we find it but what we want to consider is which,E
Thank the Lord you re here he said piously I couldn t have stood it alone Let s go outside suggested Antony It s quite warm Somewhere where we can sit down right away from the house I want to talk to you Good man What about the bowling green Oh you were going to show me that anyhow weren t you Is it somewhere where we can talk without being overheard Rather The ideal place You ll see They came out of the front door and followed the drive to the left Coming from Woodham Antony had approached the,E
other solution As regards all the rest of them Cayley the guests the servants they also were prejudiced in favour of Mark or possibly for all he knew against Mark in favour of or against each other they had formed some previous opinion from what had been said that morning of the sort of man Robert was No one of them could consider the matter with an unbiased mind But Antony could He knew nothing about Mark he knew nothing about Robert He had seen the dead man before he was told who the dead man was He knew that,E
house that afternoon from the other side The way they were going now would take them out at the opposite end of the park on the high road to Stanton a country town some three miles away They passed by a gate and a gardener s lodge which marked the limit of what auctioneers like to call the ornamental grounds of the estate and then the open park was before them Sure we haven t missed it said Antony The park lay quietly in the moonlight on either side of the drive wearing a little way ahead of them a,E
thoroughly upset about the key business He suddenly realized that he had been careless and he hadn t got time to think it all over So he didn t want to commit himself definitely to the statement that the key was either outside or inside He wanted to leave it vague It was safest that way I see said Bill slowly But his mind was elsewhere He was wondering suddenly about Cayley Cayley was just an ordinary man like himself Bill had had little jokes with him sometimes not that Cayley was much of a hand at joking Bill had,E
burglars And if a burglar gets in by the window they like to limit his activities to that particular room So they keep the keys on the _out_side of the doors and lock the doors when they go to bed He knocked the ashes out of his pipe and added At least my mother always used to You mean said Bill excitedly that the key was on the outside of the door when Mark went into the room Well I was just wondering Have you noticed the other rooms the billiard room and library and so on said Cayley I,E
He wasn t keen but Mark made him Miss Norris wasn t playing I see My dear Tony she s a professional Of course she wasn t Antony laughed again A great success was it Oh rather I m a fool and a damned fool Antony announced solemnly And a damned fool he said again under his breath as he led Bill away from the poster and out of the yard into the road And a damned fool Even now He broke off and then asked suddenly Did Mark ever have much trouble with his teeth He went to his,E
said the Inspector Robert Ablett didn t you say He took out his notebook Yes Brother of Mark Ablett who lives here Ah He began to sharpen a pencil Staying in the house Oh no Antony listened attentively while Cayley explained all that he knew about Robert This was news to him I see Sent out of the country in disgrace What had he done I hardly know I was only about twelve at the time The sort of age when you re told not to ask questions Inconvenient questions Exactly So you don t really know whether he had,E
don t see why we shouldn t get our little bit of fun out of it Neither do I All right then we ll do without the police to night We shall miss them said Bill sadly but tis better so There were two problems in front of them first the problem of getting out of the house without being discovered by Cayley and secondly the problem of recovering whatever it was which Cayley dropped into the pond that night Let s look at it from Cayley s point of view said Antony He may not know that we re,E
deceptive air of smoothness which retreated always as they advanced Rum isn t it said Bill An absurd place for a bowling green but I suppose it was always here Yes but always where It s short enough for golf perhaps but Hallo They had come to the place The road bent round to the right but they kept straight on over a broad grass path for twenty yards and there in front of them was the green A dry ditch ten feet wide and six feet deep surrounded it except in the one place where the path went forward,E
be shown in the evidence a shot was heard and when perhaps five minutes later the room was forced open the dead body of Robert Ablett was found stretched upon the floor As regards Mark Ablett nobody had seen him from the moment of his going into the room but evidence would be called to show that he had enough money on him at the time to take him to any other part of the country and that a man answering to his description had been observed on the platform of Stanton station apparently waiting to catch the 3 55,E
that her husband would drive over that afternoon for his luggage And you would like some lunch I expect sir Yes but don t give yourself any trouble about it Cold anything you ve got What about beef sir she asked as if she had a hundred varieties of meat to select from and was offering him her best That will do splendidly And a pint of beer While he was finishing his lunch the landlord came in to ask about the luggage Antony ordered another pint and soon had him talking It must be rather fun to keep a,E
this afternoon Oh of course What is it Without saying anything Antony led the way indoors to the office It was three o clock and at three o clock yesterday Antony and Cayley had found the body At a few minutes after three he had been looking out of the window of the adjoining room and had been surprised suddenly to find the door open and Cayley behind him He had vaguely wondered at the time why he had expected the door to be shut but he had had no time then to worry the thing out and he had,E
of the pond what The revolver Well anyhow they were going to watch him What fun To Antony who was older and who realized into what deep waters they were getting it did not seem fun But it was amazingly interesting He saw so much and yet somehow it was all out of focus It was like looking at an opal and discovering with every movement of it some new colour some new gleam of light reflected and yet never really seeing the opal as a whole He was too near it or too far away he strained his eyes,E
not to have thought of it when we came in The library key is outside but all the others are inside Yes I know You devil I suppose you did think of it then I did Bill said Antony apologetically Bother I hoped you d forgotten Well that knocks your theory on the head doesn t it I never had a theory I only said that _if_ they were outside it would probably mean that the office key was outside and that in that case Cayley s theory was knocked on the head Well now it isn t and we,E
need not make the foursome less enjoyable At about the time when the Major for whatever reasons was fluffing his tee shot at the sixteenth and Mark and his cousin were at their business at the Red House an attractive gentleman of the name of Antony Gillingham was handing up his ticket at Woodham station and asking the way to the village Having received directions he left his bag with the station master and walked off leisurely He is an important person to this story so that it is as well we should know something about him before letting him,E
Cayley Yes he might have but he didn t Or if he did somebody was in the room at the time and that somebody isn t here now And that somebody took a revolver away with him Well the police will want to say a word about that won t they Cayley was silent looking on the ground Oh I know what you re thinking and believe me I do sympathize with you but we can t be children about it If your cousin Mark Ablett was in the room with this he indicated the body this man then Who,E
time then while he was hammering the key in his pocket at the locked door he must suddenly have remembered with what a shock that a mistake had been made A window had not been left open Probably it would just have been a horrible doubt at first _Was_ the office window open Surely it was open _Was_ it Would he have time now to unlock the door slip in open the French windows and slip out again No At any moment the servants might come It was too risky Fatal if he were discovered But servants were stupid He,E
whistling loudly to himself He took the bowls out dropped one with a loud bang on the floor said Oh Lord and went on I say Bill I don t think I want to play bowls after all Well why did you say you did grumbled Bill Antony flashed a smile of appreciation at him Well I wanted to when I said I did and now I don t want to Then what _do_ you want to do Talk Oh right _o _ said Bill eagerly There s a seat on the lawn I saw it Let s bring these,E
listen to what they were saying He might do this merely by opening the door a little without showing himself in which case Antony would have found the entrance to the passage without any trouble to himself But when Bill turned his head and talked over the back of the seat it was probable that the listener would find it necessary to put his head outside in order to hear and then Antony would be able to discover who it was Moreover if he should venture out of his hiding place altogether and peep at them over the top of,E
once so as to identify him afterwards and he agreed that it would be middlin hard and then Give me three guesses interrupted Antony You asked him if he remembered everybody who came to his inn That s it Bright wasn t it Brilliant And what was the result The result was a woman A woman said Antony eagerly A woman said Bill impressively Of course I thought it was going to be Robert so did you didn t you but it wasn t It was a woman Came quite late on Monday night in a car driving herself went,E
er You will won t you she said to Antony Thank you very much Mrs Norbury was delighted to see them as she always was to see any man in her house who came up to the necessary standard of eligibility When her life work was completed and summed up in those beautiful words A marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between Angela daughter of the late John Norbury then she would utter a grateful _Nunc dimittis_ and depart in peace to a better world if Heaven insisted but preferably to her new son in law s,E
from the door and was hurried out again by the others wishing that she had not given her presence away But it was hard to listen in silence when she knew so well from her novelettes just what happened on these occasions I shall have to give that girl a piece of my mind said Mrs Stevens Well Elsie He said I heard him say it with my own ears It s my turn now he said triumphant like Well if you think that s a threat dear you re very particular I must say But Audrey remembered Elsie s,E
the least intimate with either Indeed of the two he preferred perhaps the silent solid Cayley to the more volatile Mark Cayley s qualities as they appeared to Bill may have been chiefly negative but even if this merit lay in the fact that he never exposed whatever weaknesses he may have had this is an excellent quality in a fellow guest or if you like fellow host in a house where one is continually visiting Mark s weaknesses on the other hand were very plain to the eye and Bill had seen a good deal of them Yet though,E
would have cried triumphantly to the world or to such part of the world as mattered A marriage has very nearly been arranged by Mrs Norbury and will certainly take place between Angela only daughter of the late John Norbury and Mark Ablett of the Red House And coming across it on his way to the sporting page Bill would have been surprised For he had thought that if anybody it was Cayley To the girl it was neither She was often amused by her mother s ways sometimes ashamed of them sometimes distressed by them The Mark Ablett affair,E
it possible a murder could be intended without any more preparation than the changing into a different suit in which to escape The thing was too childish Also if Robert was to be murdered why go out of the way to announce his existence to you all even at the cost of some trouble to Mrs Norbury What did it all mean I didn t know But I began to feel now that Robert was an incident only that the plot was a plot of Cayley s against Mark either to get him to kill his brother or to get,E
missed it Anyway said Antony if we take them down one at a time nobody can suspect us of sinister designs After all what does one go into a library for except to take books down But there s such a frightful lot Antony s pipe was now going satisfactorily and he got up and walked leisurely to the end of the wall opposite the door Well let s have a look he said and see if they are so very frightful Hallo here s your Badminton You often read that you say If I read anything Yes He looked,E
her be As for the Major I don t believe anything would frighten _him_ Where did the ghost appear Down by the bowling green That s supposed to be its haunt you know We were all down there in the moonlight pretending to wait for it Do you know the bowling green No I ll show it to you after dinner I wish you would Was Mark very angry afterwards Oh Lord yes Sulked for a whole day Well he s just like that Was he angry with all of you Oh yes sulky you know This morning Oh no,E
were sitting in the copse above the pond from which the Inspector and his fishermen had now withdrawn Bill had listened with open mouth to Antony s theory and save for an occasional By Jove had listened in silence Smart man Cayley had been his only comment at the end Which other theory That Mark had killed Robert accidentally and had gone to Cayley for help and that Cayley having hidden him in the passage locked the office door from the outside and hammered on it Yes but you were so dashed mysterious about that I asked you what the,E
Then you didn t see Mr Mark at all No sir he must have come in before and gone up to his room Or come in by the front door likely enough while I was going out by the back Yes Well I think that s all that I want to know thank you very much Now what about the other servants Elsie heard the master and Mr Robert talking together said Audrey eagerly He was saying Mr Mark I mean Ah Well I think Elsie had better tell me that herself Who is Elsie by the way One of,E
said Oh you incomparable ass He understood now It explained so much that had been puzzling him He tried to put himself in Cayley s place Cayley when Antony had first discovered him hammering at the door and crying Let me in Whatever had happened inside the office whoever had killed Robert Cayley knew all about it and knew that Mark was not inside and had not escaped by the window But it was necessary to Cayley s plans to Mark s plans if they were acting in concert that he should be thought so to have escaped At some,E
the Othello business painting himself black all over I mean he may have been so full of his appearance as Robert that he had almost got to believe in Robert and had to tell everybody More likely though he felt that having told all of you at the house he had better tell Miss Norbury in case she met one of you in which case if you mentioned the approaching arrival of Robert she might say Oh I m certain he has no brother he would have told me if he had and so spoil his joke Possibly too Cayley,E
vain fool at my mercy I was in no hurry Two years later I had to reconsider my position for my revenge was being taken out of my hands Mark began to drink Could I have stopped him I don t think so but to my immense surprise I found myself trying to Instinct perhaps getting the better of reason or did I reason it out and tell myself that if he drank himself to death I should lose my revenge Upon my word I cannot tell you but for whatever motive I did genuinely want to stop it Drinking,E
shelves and humming Sorry It got on my nerves My dear old chap I m awfully sorry I ll go out in the hall It s all right said Cayley and went on with his letter Bill sat down in his chair again Had Antony understood Well anyhow there was nothing to do now but wait for Cayley to go And if you ask me said Bill to himself much pleased I ought to be on the stage That s where I ought to be The complete actor A minute two minutes three minutes five minutes It was safe now,E
was safer to have her out of the way Yes But look here Tony why do you want to bother about _this_ end of it We can always get in at the bowling green end I know but if we do that we shall have to do it openly It will mean breaking open the box and letting Cayley know that we ve done it You see Bill if we don t find anything out for ourselves in the next day or two we ve got to tell the police what we _have_ found out and then they can explore,E
appear here because this is where the original one Lady Anne you know was supposed to walk Oh never mind Lady Anne A real ghost can do anything But how did Miss Norris appear suddenly over five hundred yards of bare park Bill looked at Antony with open mouth I I don t know he stammered We never thought of that You would have seen her long before wouldn t you if she had come the way we came Of course we should And that would have spoilt it rather You would have had time to recognize her walk Bill,E
it seemed to the watchers he stood there very big very silent in the moonlight At last he seemed satisfied Whatever his secret was he had hidden it and so with a gentle sigh as unmistakable to Antony as if he had heard it Cayley turned away and vanished again as quietly as he had come Antony gave him three minutes and stepped out from the trees He waited there for Bill to join him Six whispered Bill Antony nodded I m going round to the front of the house You get back to your tree and watch in case,E
and wonder what on earth he s doing in your room at all You know the sort of thing Right And about the dummy figure I ll make it up directly we come upstairs and hide it under the bed Yes I think we d better go completely to bed ourselves We shan t take a moment dressing again and it will give him time to get safely into the passage Then come into my room Right Are you ready Yes They went downstairs together CHAPTER XVII Mr Beverley Takes the Water Cayley seemed very fond of them that night,E
stopped and looked at Bill comically let s ask him what he s going to do with the key of the office For a moment Bill did not understand Key of the office he said vaguely You don t mean Tony What do you mean Good God do you mean that Cayley But what about Mark I don t know where Mark is that s another thing I want to know but I m quite certain that he hasn t got the key of the office with him Because Cayley s got it Are you sure Quite Bill looked at,E
on guard while he himself follows a train of thought in another direction Many people do this of course when for instance they are talking to one person and trying to listen to another but their eyes betray them Antony s never did He had seen a good deal of the world with those eyes though never as a sailor When at the age of twenty one he came into his mother s money 400 a year old Gillingham looked up from the Stockbreeders Gazette to ask what he was going to do See the world said Antony Well send,E
on his track but he can t help being suspicious of us He s bound to be suspicious of everybody in the house and more particularly of us because we re presumably more intelligent than the others He stopped for a moment to light his pipe and Bill took the opportunity of looking more intelligent than Mrs Stevens Now he has got something to hide to night and he s going to take good care that we aren t watching him Well what will he do See that we are asleep first before he starts out Yes Come and tuck,E
know that he announced his approaching arrival to Mark in a rather unpleasant letter which I have in my pocket Yes And then we know rather a curious thing We know that Mark told you all that this black sheep was coming Now why did he tell you Bill was thoughtful for a moment I suppose he said slowly that he knew we were bound to see him and thought that the best way was to be quite frank about him But were you bound to see him You were all away playing golf We were bound to see him,E
good of you but I shall have to go over myself anyhow to pack up and pay my bill Besides it s a good evening for a walk If you wouldn t mind it Bill I should love it Well then if you leave the bag there I ll send the car round for it later Thanks very much Having said what he wanted to say Cayley remained there a little awkwardly as if not sure whether to go or to stay Antony wondered whether he wanted to talk about the afternoon s happenings or whether it was the one,E
her favourite author was advertised on the cover with a picture of the villain falling over the cliff That s where _you ll_ go to my girl if you aren t careful said Mrs Stevens firmly But of course there was no need to confess all these crimes to Inspector Birch All that interested him was that she was passing through the hall and heard voices in the office And stopped to listen Certainly not said Elsie with dignity feeling that nobody really understood her I was just passing through the hall just as you might have been yourself and,E
on Only remember the key is on the outside of the door to start with Yes well I don t mind that Mark goes in to see his brother and they quarrel and all the rest of it just as Cayley was saying Cayley hears the shot and in order to give Mark time to get away locks the door puts the key in his pocket and pretends that Mark has locked the door and that he can t get in How s that Hopeless Watson hopeless Why How does Cayley know that it is Mark who has shot Robert,E
Antony had guessed Is the car there asked Cayley as he sealed up his letter Bill strolled into the hall called back Yes and went out to talk to the chauffeur Cayley joined him and they stood there for a moment Hallo said a pleasant voice behind them They turned round and saw Antony Sorry to keep you waiting Bill With a tremendous effort Bill restrained his feelings and said casually enough that it was all right Well I must be off said Cayley You re going down to the village That s the idea I wonder if you d,E
was the evidence of the breakfast table Mark had seemed annoyed at this resurrection of the black sheep but certainly not frightened No that was much too thin a story But suppose Mark had actually seen his brother and had a quarrel with him suppose it could be made to look as if Robert had killed Mark Antony pictured to himself Cayley in the passage standing over the dead body of his cousin and working it out How could Robert be made to seem the murderer if Robert were alive to deny it But suppose Robert were dead too He,E
would you have heard it I think so Unless they had come out very quietly on purpose Would you call Mark a hasty tempered man Cayley considered this carefully before answering Hasty tempered yes he said But not violent tempered Was he fairly athletic Active and quick Active and quick yes Not particularly strong Yes One question more Was Mark in the habit of carrying any considerable sum of money about with him Yes He always had one 100 note on him and perhaps ten or twenty pounds as well Thank you Mr Cayley Cayley went back heavily to his,E
financial adviser his courier his but this most of all his audience Mark could never live alone There must always be somebody to listen to him I think in his heart he hoped I should be his Boswell He told me one day that he had made me his literary executor poor devil And he used to write me the absurdest long letters when I was away from him letters which I read once and then tore up The futility of the man It was three years ago that Philip got into trouble He had been hurried through a cheap,E
lid of the closed croquet box As he expected it was locked Now then said Bill as they were walking back to the house again I m simply bursting to know Who was it Cayley Good Lord Where Inside one of the croquet boxes Don t be an ass It s quite true Bill He told the other what he had seen But aren t we going to have a look at it asked Bill in great disappointment I m longing to explore Aren t you To morrow and to morrow and to morrow We shall see Cayley coming along,E
to them and went into the house Well said Miss Norris dramatically As Antony re entered the hall the Inspector from Middleston was just crossing into the library with Cayley The latter stopped and nodded to Antony Wait a moment Inspector Here s Mr Gillingham He d better come with us And then to Antony This is Inspector Birch Birch looked inquiringly from one to the other Mr Gillingham and I found the body together explained Cayley Oh Well come along and let s get the facts sorted out a bit I like to know where I am Mr Gillingham,E
the housemaids Shall I send her to you sir Please Elsie was not sorry to get the message It interrupted a few remarks from Mrs Stevens about Elsie s conduct that afternoon which were Elsie thought much better interrupted In Mrs Stevens opinion any crime committed that afternoon in the office was as nothing to the double crime committed by the unhappy Elsie For Elsie realized too late that she would have done better to have said nothing about her presence in the hall that afternoon She was bad at concealing the truth and Mrs Stevens was good at discovering,E
quite happy unless he had Cayley doing something for him He was quite lost and helpless without him And funnily enough Cayley seemed lost without Mark He was fond of him Yes I should say so In a protective kind of way He d sized Mark up of course his vanity his self importance his amateurishness and all the rest of it but he liked looking after him And he knew how to manage him Yes What sort of terms was he on with the guests you and Miss Norris and all of them Just polite and rather silent you,E
words when she was in front of Inspector Birch She gave her own evidence with the readiness of one who had already repeated it several times and was examined and cross examined by the Inspector with considerable skill The temptation to say Never mind about what _you_ said to _him_ was strong but he resisted it knowing that in this way he would discover best what _he_ said to _her_ By this time both his words and the looks he gave her were getting their full value from Audrey but the general meaning of them seemed to be well established,E
told Mrs Norbury about him on Monday What do you make of that Coincidence said Bill after careful thought He d always meant to tell her his suit was prospering and just before it was finally settled he told her That happened to be Monday On Tuesday he got Robert s letter and felt jolly glad that he d told her in time Well it might be that but it s rather a curious coincidence And here is something which makes it very curious indeed It only occurred to me in the bath this morning Inspiring place a bathroom Well,E
I don t think that there is any more to tell you This is a long letter but then it is the last which I shall write There was a time when I hoped that there might be a happy future for me not at the Red House not alone Perhaps it was never more than an idle day dream for I am no more worthy of her than Mark was But I could have made her happy Mr Gillingham God how I would have worked to make her happy But now that is impossible To offer her the hand,E
again after tea I had to give her half fifteen according to his handicap but somehow Bill stopped and shrugged his shoulders It didn t quite fit in No It spoilt the effect of his tournament Took the edge off it just a little I suppose he felt So we didn t play He laughed and added It would have been as much as our place was worth to have played Do you mean you wouldn t have been asked here again Probably Well I don t know Not for some time anyway Really Bill Oh rather He s a,E
that rather odd Well I thought so at first but He pointed to the wall jutting out on the right You see you re protected from the rest of the house if you get out here and you re quite close to the shrubbery If you go out at the French windows I imagine you re much more visible All that part of the house he waved his right hand the west well north west almost where the kitchen parts are you see you re hidden from them here Oh yes he knew the house whoever it was and he,E
wash out he said Now let s have yours Antony did not answer him He had begun to think about something quite different CHAPTER IX Possibilities of a Croquet Set What s the matter said Bill sharply Antony looked round at him with raised eyebrows You ve thought of something suddenly said Bill What is it Antony laughed My dear Watson he said you aren t supposed to be as clever as this Oh you can t take _me_ in No Well I was wondering about this ghost of yours Bill It seems to me Oh _that _ Bill was,E
frightened But what I m frightened of I don t quite know Anyway you want to go on with it don t you Yes said Bill firmly We must Then we ll explore the passage this afternoon if we get the chance And if we don t get the chance then we ll try it to night They walked across the hall and out into the sunlight again Do you really think we might find Mark hiding there asked Bill It s possible said Antony Either Mark or He pulled himself up quickly No he murmured to himself I won,E
a very natural sound a deep breath from a heavy sleeper He added another one to it to make it seem more natural The door was shut Bill counted a hundred slowly and then got up As quickly and as noiselessly as possible he dressed himself in the dark He put the dummy figure in the bed arranged the clothes so that just enough but not too much of it was showing and stood by the door looking at it For a casual glance the room was just about light enough Then very quietly very slowly he opened the door,E
read of detective stories inspectors always do want to drag the pond first Is it deep Quite deep enough said Cayley as he got up On his way to the door he stopped and looked at Antony I m so sorry that we re keeping you here like this but it will only be until to morrow The inquest is to morrow afternoon Do amuse yourself how you like till then Beverley will look after you Thanks very much I shall really be quite all right Antony went on with his breakfast Perhaps it was true that inspectors liked dragging,E
the Plough and Horses Antony looked comically at him You ll never forgive me Bill he said You ll never come clue hunting with me again What do you mean Antony sighed It was a fake Watson I wanted you out of the way I wanted to be alone I d guessed at my x and I wanted to test it to test it every way by everything we d discovered I simply _had_ to be alone just then So he smiled and added Well I knew you wanted a drink You _are_ a devil said Bill staring at him,E
Cayley had provided the necessary traces since and had helped the Inspector to find them Had he even gone as far as footmarks in Mark s shoes But the ground was very hard Perhaps footmarks were not necessary Antony smiled as he thought of the big Cayley trying to squeeze into the dapper little Mark s shoes Cayley must have been glad that footmarks were not necessary No the open window was enough the open window and a broken twig or two But quietly quietly Antony mustn t hear And Antony had not heard But he had seen a shadow,E
off to their golf only twenty four hours ago How could he help feeling that this was not real tragedy but merely a jolly kind of detective game that he and Antony were playing He turned back to his friend All the same he said you wanted to find the passage and now you ve found it Aren t you going into it at all Antony took his arm Let s go outside again he said We can t go into it now anyhow It s too risky with Cayley about Bill I feel like you just a little bit,E
thought it my duty to warn her that Mark took any joke against himself badly but she was determined to do it I gave way reluctantly Reluctantly also I told her the secret of the passage There is an underground passage from the library to the bowling green You should exercise your ingenuity Mr Gillingham in trying to discover it Mark came upon it by accident a year ago It was a godsend to him he could drink there in greater secrecy But he had to tell me about it He wanted an audience even for his vices I told,E
I know he s in because he told me that you were coming this afternoon Oh He looked round the room What d you call this place eh The office sir The office The room where the master works sir Works eh That s new Didn t know he d ever done a stroke of work in his life Where he _writes_ sir said Audrey with dignity The fact that Mr Mark wrote though nobody knew what was a matter of pride in the housekeeper s room Not well dressed enough for the drawing room eh I will tell the,E
office this afternoon and that Cayley knows exactly how he died That s all It doesn t follow that Cayley killed him No No of course it doesn t Bill gave a sigh of relief He s just shielding Mark what I wonder Well isn t that the simplest explanation It s the simplest if you re a friend of Cayley and want to let him down lightly But then I m not you see Why isn t it simple anyhow Well let s have the explanation then and I ll undertake to give you a simpler one afterwards Go,E
down and up the shelf Sport and Travel chiefly I like books of travel don t you They re pretty dull as a rule Well anyhow some people like them very much said Antony reproachfully He moved on to the next row of shelves The Drama The Restoration dramatists You can have most of them Still as you well remark many people seem to love them Shaw Wilde Robertson I like reading plays Bill There are not many people who do but those who do are usually very keen Let us pass on I say we haven t too much,E
he wanted all of us to believe in her and yet he was annoyed with Betty and Mrs Calladine for believing in ghosts at all Rum chap Well anyhow Miss Norris she s an actress some actress too dressed up as the ghost and played the fool a bit And poor Mark was frightened out of his life Just for a moment you know What about the others Well Betty and I knew in fact I d told her Miss Norris I mean not to be a silly ass Knowing Mark Mrs Calladine wasn t there Betty wouldn t let,E
was not and Antony assumed from this that Cayley was very much alive to the necessity for her absence Why Well that question was not to be answered off hand But the fact that it was so had made Antony interested in her and it was for this reason that he had followed up so alertly Bill s casual mention of her in connection with the dressing up business He felt that he wanted to know a little more about Miss Norris and the part she had played in the Red House circle By sheer luck as it seemed to,E
it Elsie knew perfectly well that she had no business to come down the front stairs and it was no excuse to say that she happened to come out of Miss Norris room just at the head of the stairs and didn t think it would matter as there was nobody in the hall and what was she doing anyhow in Miss Norris room at that time Returning a magazine Lent by Miss Norris might she ask Well not exactly lent Really Elsie and this in a respectable house In vain for poor Elsie to plead that a story by,E
He took the two keys out of his pocket One of them is the office key I suppose and the other is the key of the passage cupboard So I thought that perhaps we might have a look at the cupboard I say do you really think it is Well I don t see what else it can be But why should he want to throw it away Because it has now done its work whatever it was and he wants to wash his hands of the passage He d throw the passage away if he could I don t,E
down at the house which they had left Jolly little place isn t it said Bill Very But rather mysterious In what way Well where s the front door The front door Why you ve just come out of it But isn t there a drive or a road or anything Bill laughed No that s the beauty of it to some people And that s why it s so cheap and why the Norburys can afford it I expect They re not too well off But what about luggage and tradesmen and that kind of thing Oh there s,E

no said Cayley with a little laugh An awkward uncomfortable little laugh it seemed to Bill Nor do I He was past the sermons now past the secret door but still tapping in the same aimless way Oh for God s sake sit down burst out Cayley Or go outside if you want to walk about Bill turned round in astonishment Hallo what s the matter Cayley was slightly ashamed of his outburst Sorry Bill he apologized My nerves are on edge Your constant tapping and fidgeting about Tapping said Bill with an air of complete surprise Tapping on the,E
it all out Antony nodded At least I m very nearly there Bill There s just this one thing I want now It means your going back to Stanton Well we haven t come far it won t take you long Do you mind My dear Holmes I am at your service Antony gave him a smile and was silent for a little thinking Is there another inn at Stanton fairly close to the station The Plough and Horses just at the corner where the road goes up to the station is that the one you mean That would be,E
watch you he said and he had watched them resolutely until the game and then another game after that had been played They went into the hall and attacked the drinks Well thank heaven for bed said Bill putting down his glass Are you coming Yes said Antony and finished his drink He looked at Cayley I ve just got one or two little things to do said Cayley I shan t be long following you Well good night then Good night Good night called Bill from half way up the stairs Good night Tony Good night Bill looked at,E
windows to open windows such air as there was played gently The staircase went up in broad low steps along the right hand wall and turning to the left led you along a gallery which ran across the width of the hall to your bedroom That is if you were going to stay the night Mr Robert Ablett s intentions in this matter were as yet unknown As Audrey came across the hall she gave a little start as she saw Mr Cayley suddenly sitting unobtrusively in a seat beneath one of the front windows reading No reason why he,E
a childish fit of temper Bill grunted assent but without prejudice to Mark All the same he said I can t believe it That he would do it deliberately I mean Suppose it was an accident as Cayley says would he lose his head and run away Bill considered for a moment Yes I really think he might you know He nearly ran away when he saw the ghost Of course that s different rather Oh I don t know In each case it s a question of obeying your instinct instead of your reason They had left the open,E
he said and that s the funny thing about it You re sure it is the lot What do you mean Give me the torch a moment He took it and flashed it over the ground between them Yes that s the lot It s funny He stood up the bag in his hands Now let s find a hiding place for these and then He said no more but stepped off through the trees Bill following him meekly As soon as they had got the bag off their hands and were clear of the copse Antony became more communicative,E
his brother to kill him and that for some inexplicable reason Mark seemed to be lending himself to the plot He was silent for a little and then said almost to himself I had seen the empty brandy bottles in that cupboard You never said anything about them complained Bill I only saw them afterwards I was looking for the collar you remember They came back to me afterwards I knew how Cayley would feel about it Poor devil Go on said Bill Well then we had the inquest and of course I noticed and I suppose you did too,E
me as soon as I m in a line with your two marks He rowed slowly towards the middle of the pond You re about there now said Bill at last Antony stopped rowing and looked about him Yes that s pretty well right He turned the boat s nose round until it was pointing to the pine tree under which Bill had lain You see my tree and the other coat Yes said Bill Right Now then I m going to row gently along this line until we re dead in between the two Get it as exact as,E
his pipe but could think of nothing to say Anyhow said Antony getting up restlessly I m certain of one thing Mark knew on the Monday that Robert was coming here CHAPTER XIX The Inquest The Coroner having made a few commonplace remarks as to the terrible nature of the tragedy which they had come to investigate that afternoon proceeded to outline the case to the jury Witnesses would be called to identify the deceased as Robert Ablett the brother of the owner of the Red House Mark Ablett It would be shown that he was something of a ne,E
in your bed that looked vaguely like you in the dark A bolster with a pyjama coat round it and one arm outside the blanket and a pair of socks or something for the head You know the kind of thing I think it would please him to feel that you were still sleeping peacefully Bill chuckled to himself Rather I m awfully good at that I ll make him up something really good But what about you I m at the other end of the house he s hardly likely to bother about me a second time And I,E
puffing at his pipe he said slowly Has Cayley shot himself Antony shrugged his shoulders Poor devil said Bill It was decent of you to give him a chance I m glad you did I couldn t help liking Cayley in a kind of way you know He s a clever devil If you hadn t turned up just when you did he would never have been found out I wonder It was ingenious but it s often the ingenious thing which gets found out The awkward thing from Cayley s point of view was that though Mark was missing,E
suggest It seems sound enough said Bill Sort of thing you d do without thinking Besides if you are going to run away it gives you more of a chance Yes that s all right if the key is there But suppose it isn t there The suggestion made as if it were already an established fact startled them both They looked at him wonderingly What do you mean said Cayley Well it s just a question of where people happen to keep their keys You go up to your bedroom and perhaps you like to lock your door in,E
in front of Cayley If you please sir she said in a low respectful voice can you tell me where the master is It s Mr Robert called What said Cayley looking up from his book Who Audrey repeated her question I don t know Isn t he in the office He went up to the Temple after lunch I don t think I ve seen him since Thank you sir I will go up to the Temple Cayley returned to his book The Temple was a brick summer house in the gardens at the back of the house about,E
stay as he wished could have been left safely to them As it was they had been given no alternative and Miss Norris who had proposed to catch an after dinner train at the junction in the obvious hope that she might have in this way a dramatic cross examination at the hands of some keen eyed detective was encouraged tactfully but quite firmly to travel by the earlier train with the others Antony had felt that Cayley in the tragedy which had suddenly befallen the house ought to have been equally indifferent to her presence or absence But he,E
notice and patronage of some rich old spinster of the neighbourhood who had paid for his education both at school and university At about the time when he was coming down from Cambridge his father had died leaving behind him a few debts as a warning to his family and a reputation for short sermons as an example to his successor Neither warning nor example seems to have been effective Mark went to London with an allowance from his patron and it is generally agreed made acquaintance with the money lenders He was supposed by his patron and any others,E
in my bath this morning began Antony The brightest one of all was that we were being damn fools and working at this thing from the wrong end altogether Well that s helpful Of course it s very hampering being a detective when you don t know anything about detecting and when nobody knows that you re doing detection and you can t have people up to cross examine them and you have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries and in short when you re doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur haphazard way For,E
on the previous day looked up after him as he went Bill turned into the room on the right opened the drawer and got the handkerchief damped the sponge and came back Well he said wonderingly Antony shook his head It s all different he said For one thing you made a devil of a noise and Cayley didn t Perhaps you weren t listening when Cayley went in I wasn t But I should have heard him if I could have heard him and I should have remembered afterwards Perhaps Cayley shut the door after him Wait He pressed,E
a dentist for that Who could do it better Could _you_ have done it How could you You d never gone bathing with Mark you d never seen him stripped He didn t swim Could his doctor do it Not unless he d had some particular operation and perhaps not then But his dentist could at any time always if he had been to his dentist fairly often Hence Mr Cartwright of Wimpole Street Bill nodded thoughtfully and went back again to the letter I see And you told Cayley that you were telegraphing to Cartwright to identify the body,E
back for us said Bill brilliantly It s certainly much cooler here than I expected put in the Major Mrs Calladine fell It was very pleasantly cool outside the golf house and of course Mark _would_ be rather glad to have them out of the way So she consented to nine holes and the match having ended all square and everybody having played much better than in the morning they drove back to the Red House very well pleased with themselves Hallo said Bill to himself as they approached the house isn t that old Tony Antony was standing in,E
the dullest books I could find the books nobody ever read Obviously the collection of sermon books of a mid Victorian clergyman was the shelf we wanted Yes I see But why were you so certain of the particular place Well he had to mark the particular place by _some_ book I thought that the joke of putting The Narrow Way just over the entrance to the passage might appeal to him Apparently it did Bill nodded to himself thoughtfully several times Yes that s very neat he said You re a clever devil Tony Tony laughed You encourage me,E
game or sport that s ever been invented and as I say one gets awfully well done but with it all Tony there s a faint sort of feeling that well that one is on parade as it were You ve got to do as you re told How do you mean Well Mark fancies himself rather at arranging things He arranges things and it s understood that the guests fall in with the arrangement For instance Betty Miss Calladine and I were going to play a single just before tea the other day Tennis She s frightfully hot stuff,E
beard I d shave it off he snapped My dear Mark He looked away and mumbled I ve been thinking of taking it off anyhow And besides if I m going to do the thing I m going to do it properly Yes you always were an artist I said looking at him admiringly He purred To be called an artist was what he longed for most Now I knew that I had him All the same I went on even without your beard and moustache you might be recognizable Unless of course I broke off Unless what You pretend,E
He broke off and shrugged his shoulders May have drowned himself knowing that he couldn t get away And knowing that he had compromised himself by trying to get away at all Yes I suppose so said Cayley slowly I should have thought he would have given himself more of a run for his money After all he had a revolver If he was determined not to be taken alive he could always have prevented that Couldn t he have caught a train to London before the police knew anything about it He might just have managed it There _was_,E
of course you did Who says you didn t Some of the others sir Mrs Stevens and all Oh that s just because they re jealous said Antony with a smile He was glad to have spoken to her because he had recognized at once the immense importance of her evidence To the Inspector no doubt it had seemed only of importance in that it had shown Mark to have adopted something of a threatening attitude towards his brother To Antony it had much more significance It was the only trustworthy evidence that Mark had been in the office at,E

why not Cayley But perhaps it had not been such a cold blooded killing after all Suppose Cayley had had a quarrel with his cousin that afternoon over the girl whom they were both wooing Suppose Cayley had killed Mark either purposely in sudden passion or accidentally meaning only to knock him down Suppose that this had happened in the passage say about two o clock either because Cayley had deliberately led him there or because Mark had casually suggested a visit to it One could imagine Mark continually gloating over that secret passage Suppose Cayley there with the body,E
Not I Are there any points on which you would like to correct Mr Cayley anything that he left out after you arrived here No thanks He described it all very accurately Ah Well now about yourself You re not staying in the house I gather Antony explained his previous movements Yes Did you hear the shot Antony put his head on one side as if listening Yes Just as I came in sight of the house It didn t make any impression at the time but I remember it now Where were you then Coming up the drive I,E
to hide in that pond that night Antony thought that he knew now It was Mark s body From the beginning he had seen this answer coming and had drawn back from it For if Mark had been killed it seemed such a cold blooded killing Was Cayley equal to it Bill would have said No but that was because he had had breakfast with Cayley and lunch with him and dinner with him had ragged him and played games with him Bill would have said No because Bill wouldn t have killed anybody in cold blood himself and because,E

know Keeping himself to himself We didn t see so very much of him except at meals We were here to enjoy ourselves and well _he_ wasn t He wasn t there when the ghost walked No I heard Mark calling for him when he went back to the house I expect Cayley stroked down his feathers a bit and told him that girls will be girls Hallo here we are They went into the inn and while Bill made himself pleasant to the landlady Antony went upstairs to his room It appeared that he had not very much packing,E
to be kept secret When did he change The only possible time was between lunch when he would be seen by the servants and the moment of Robert s arrival And when did Cayley collect the clothes in a bundle Again the only answer was Before Robert s arrival So another x was wanted to fit those three conditions And the answer was that a murder was intended even before Robert arrived Yes Well now it couldn t be intended on the strength of that letter unless there was very much more behind the letter than we knew Nor was,E

look for Mark and having failed to find him come back to the office to find me entertaining Robert in Mark s absence I would explain that Mark must have gone out somewhere and would myself introduce the wastrel brother to the tea table Mark s absence would not excite any comment for it would be generally felt indeed Robert would suggest it that he had been afraid of meeting his brother Then Robert would make himself amusingly offensive to the guests particularly of course Miss Norris until he thought that the joke had gone far enough That was our,E

boy grew up Mark s designs for his future were based on his own interests as much as those of his cousin and that a suitably educated Matthew Cayley of twenty three was felt by him to be a useful property for a man in his position a man that is to say whose vanities left him so little time for his affairs Cayley then at twenty three looked after his cousin s affairs By this time Mark had bought the Red House and the considerable amount of land which went with it Cayley superintended the necessary staff His duties,E
Society a climber but in the neighbourhood of Parnassus not Hay Hill His patronage did not stop at the Arts It also included Matthew Cayley a small cousin of thirteen whose circumstances were as limited as had been Mark s own before his patron had rescued him He sent the Cayley cousin to school and Cambridge His motives no doubt were unworldly enough at first a mere repaying to his account in the Recording Angel s book of the generosity which had been lavished on himself a laying up of treasure in heaven But it is probable that as the,E
simply because there was more credit attached to it A sensational arrest of somebody in the house would have given him more pleasure than a commonplace pursuit of Mark Ablett across country Mark must be found guilty or not guilty But there were other possibilities It would have interested Antony to know that just at the time when he was feeling rather superior to the prejudiced inspector the Inspector himself was letting his mind dwell lovingly upon the possibilities in connection with Mr Gillingham Was it only a coincidence that Mr Gillingham had turned up just when he did And,E

new profession he adopted and he felt that there might come a time after the inquest say when he could not decently remain at the Red House as a guest a friend of Bill s enjoying the hospitality of Mark or Cayley whichever was to be regarded as his host without forfeiting his independent attitude towards the events of that afternoon At present he was staying in the house merely as a necessary witness and since he was there Cayley could not object to him using his eyes but if after the inquest it appeared that there was still work,E
being what he wished most to be an artist No Othello ever blacked himself all over with such enthusiasm as did Mark His beard was going anyhow possible a chance remark of Miss Norbury s helped here She did not like beards But it was important for me that the dead man s hands should not be the hands of a manicured gentleman Five minutes playing upon the vanity of the artist settled his hands He let the nails grow and then cut them raggedly Miss Norris would notice your hands at once I had said Besides as an artist,E

if he stayed in the house that night Very well then That s one thing we ve discovered Mark knew that Robert was staying in the house that night Or shall we put it this way he knew that there was no chance of getting Robert out of the house at once Bill looked at his friend eagerly Go on he said This is getting interesting He also knew something else went on Antony He knew that Robert was bound to betray his real character to you as soon as you met him He couldn t pass him off on,E
myself and some of the servants I don t know which Of course you will ask them directly no doubt With your permission No guests They were out all day playing golf explained Cayley Oh by the way he put in if I may interrupt a moment will you want to see them at all It isn t very pleasant for them now naturally and I suggested he turned to Antony who nodded back to him I understand that they want to go back to London this evening There s no objection to that I suppose You will let me,E

look at the two brothers In conjunction this time with Mrs Norbury Mrs Norbury said Bill surprised Yes Mark hoped to marry Miss Norbury Now if Robert really was a blot upon the family honour Mark would want to do one of two things Either keep it from the Norburys altogether or else if it had to come out tell them himself before the news came to them indirectly Well he told them But the funny thing is that he told them the day before Robert s letter came Robert came and was killed the day before yesterday Tuesday Mark,E
room key at the time I must have done so without knowing Probably when I saw Cayley banging at the door I may have wondered subconsciously whether the key of the room next to it would fit Something like that I daresay Well when I was sitting out by myself on that seat just before you came along I went over the whole scene in my mind and I suddenly saw the billiard room key there outside And I began to wonder if the office key had been outside too When Cayley came up I told you my idea and,E
which Cayley had been The window was open and he looked out at the well kept grass beneath him and the peaceful stretch of park beyond and he felt very sorry for the owner of it all who was now mixed up in so grim a business Cayley thinks he did it said Antony to himself That s obvious It explains why he wasted so much time banging on the door Why should he try to break a lock when it s so much easier to break a window Of course he might just have lost his head on the,E

So with his underclothes It was hardly necessary to warn him that his pants might show above the edge of his socks as an artist he had already decided upon Robertian pants I bought them and other things in London for him Even if I had not cut out all trace of the maker s name he would instinctively have done it As an Australian and an artist he could not have an East London address on his underclothes Yes we were doing the thing thoroughly both of us he as an artist I as a well you may say,E
to the windows of the locked room French windows which opened on to the lawns at the back of the house But now they were closed Antony couldn t help feeling a thrill of excitement as he followed Cayley s example and put his face close up to the glass For the first time he wondered if there really _had_ been a revolver shot in this mysterious room It had all seemed so absurd and melodramatic from the other side of the door But if there had been one shot why should there not be two more at the careless,E
