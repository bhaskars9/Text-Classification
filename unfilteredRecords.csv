from Dundee If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter But as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer It is possible More than that It is probable And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why I urged young Openshaw to caution The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders,A
As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for self restraint Disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked No no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom But I am so sure,A

story which we had listened to in the morning It was a poky little shabby genteel place where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere Three gilt balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red headed client carried on his business Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one,A

my dear sir said Holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think It appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex Consider what is involved by your theory You suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing room opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of,A

almost as bright as day I was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was It was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done And now,A
of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr Neville St Clair with the exception of his coat His boots his socks his hat and his watch all were there There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of Mr Neville St Clair Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains,A
said he And pray what am I charged with With making away with Mr Neville St Oh come you can t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin Well I have been twenty seven years in the force but this really takes the cake If I am Mr Neville St Clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore I am illegally detained No crime but a very great error has been committed said Holmes You would have done better to have,A
such a very positive one too She has heard of you and would have your opinion though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done Why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life Her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern Oh Mr Sherlock,A

Pa perhaps to show him that I was alive It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back So Frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them so that I should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to morrow only that this good gentleman Mr Holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than,A
amusement but the father s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking My sole duties then I asked are to take charge of a single child No no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried Your duty would be as I am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey You see no difficulty heh I should be happy to make myself useful Quite so In dress now for example We are,A
What danger do you foresee Holmes shook his head gravely It would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he But at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help That is enough She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now I shall write to Mr Rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair to night and start for Winchester to morrow With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both,A

you find a trout in the milk to quote Thoreau s example But I have heard all that you have heard Without however the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco Prussian War It is one of these cases but hullo here is Lestrade Good afternoon Lestrade You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box The official detective was attired in a pea jacket,A

at least a strong balance of probability That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days He had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him My dear Holmes He has,A
better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didn t make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be Ah said Holmes I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that I can deduce all that remains Mr Rucastle then I presume took to this system of imprisonment Yes sir And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr Fowler That was it,A

listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us You must know said he that I am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in London By profession I am a hydraulic engineer and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner Matheson the well known firm of Greenwich Two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers,A

among the trees That is The Cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already I have little doubt caught the clink of our horse s feet But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street I asked Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here Mrs St Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague I hate to meet her Watson when I have no news of her husband Here,A

an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever I think that I have seen now all that there is to see Mr Holder said he I can serve you best by returning to my rooms But the gems Mr Holmes Where are they I cannot tell The banker wrung his hands I shall never see them again he cried And my son You give me hopes My opinion is in no way altered Then for God s sake what was this dark business which,A
the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds It struck cold to our hearts and I stood gazing at Holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose What can it mean I gasped It means that it is all over Holmes answered And perhaps after all it is for the best Take your pistol and we will enter Dr Roylott s room With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor Twice he struck at the chamber door,A
and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me I gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the Lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me I heard her voice downstairs but I knew that she could not ascend Swiftly I threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments,A
down to arduous work at 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still It was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers Only one man knew my secret He was the keeper of a low den in which,A

a Fashionable Wedding The family of Lord Robert St Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding The ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by,A
Holmes that I make a mistake in explaining _Omne ignotum pro magnifico_ you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid Can you not find the advertisement Mr Wilson Yes I have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column Here it is This is what began it all You just read it for yourself sir I took the paper from him and read as follows TO THE RED HEADED LEAGUE On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins of Lebanon,A

and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us Farewell then said the old man solemnly Your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room God help us said Holmes after a long silence Why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter s words and say There but for the,A

like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason Then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy chair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ You have come to me to tell your story have you not said he You are fatigued with your haste Pray wait,A

weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely I could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened It swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek They say that away down in the village and even in,A
all I make nothing of it I answered frankly It is a most mysterious business As a rule said Holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be It is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify But I must be prompt over this matter What are you going to do then I asked To smoke he answered It is quite a three pipe problem and I beg that you won t speak to me for fifty minutes He curled himself up in,A

the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South Eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date You will observe said Holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers It may well have been cause and effect It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track You can understand that this register,A
and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff Pray continue your very interesting statement There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine He said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all However when our turn came the little man was much more,A
bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as I approached Tell me dad said she looking I thought a little disturbed did you give Lucy the maid leave to go out to night Certainly not She came in just now,A
and wig Even a wife s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me I threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning Then I seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings I hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the Thames,A
how you reach your results I reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag I think Watson that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast VII THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown a pipe rack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers,A
and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul At such times I have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin Well to come to an end of the matter Mr Holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back We found him when we went to search for him face downward,A
forward and found him standing by the pool He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm I had not gone more than 150 yards however when I heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again I found my father expiring upon the ground with his head,A

unlocked his strong box and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many pointed radiance Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it The game s up Ryder said Holmes quietly Hold up man or you ll be into the fire Give him an arm back into his chair Watson He s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity Give him a dash of brandy So Now he looks a little more human What a shrimp it is to be sure,A

St Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead What will the Duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation It is the purest accident I cannot allow that there is any humiliation Ah you look on these things from another standpoint I fail to see that anyone is to blame I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted Having no mother she had no one to advise her at such,A

hardly consider that a conclusive proof Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured Yes it was twisted Do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it God bless you You are doing what you can for him and for me But it is too heavy a task What was he doing there at all If his purpose were innocent why did he not say so Precisely And if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie His silence appears to me to cut both ways There are several singular points about,A
utterly crushed Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them It was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference It was worth an effort to preserve it The daughter was of a,A

jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals I suppose I remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime No,A
a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him I hope we may clear him Miss Turner said Sherlock Holmes You may rely upon my doing all that I can But you have read the evidence You have formed some conclusion Do you not see some loophole some flaw Do you not yourself think that he is innocent I think that it is very probable There now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade You hear He gives me hopes Lestrade shrugged his shoulders I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick,A
beautiful countryside You horrify me But the reason is very obvious The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkard s blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock But look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled,A

the repulsive sneer to the face A twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sad faced refined looking man black haired and smooth skinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment Then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow Great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man I know him from the photograph The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny Be it so,A
face is as black as a tinker s Well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and I think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it I should like to see him very much Would you That is easily done Come this way You can leave your bag No I think that I ll take it Very good Come this way if you please He led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with,A

to go into your room and bar your shutters Miss Stoner did so and Holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar Then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry Hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted Well we shall see if,A

This is very interesting You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is How very absurd I never noticed that before Very strange muttered Holmes pulling at the rope There are one or two very singular points about this room For example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air That is also quite modern said the lady Done about the same time as the bell rope remarked Holmes,A

Mon Andermatt is willing or not he will be henceforth our collaborator in the work we have undertaken Daspry and I were dining together on the day on which that announcement appeared That evening with the newspapers spread over my table we discussed the affair and examined it from every point of view with that exasperation that a person feels when walking in the dark and finding himself constantly falling over the same obstacles Suddenly without any warning whatsoever the door opened and a lady entered Her face was hidden behind a thick veil I rose at once and approached,B

detective did not move He appeared to be petrified he examined the room in a listless manner The windows closed The locks on the doors intact Not a break in the ceiling not a hole in the floor Everything was in perfect order The theft had been carried out methodically according to a logical and inexorable plan Arsène Lupin Arsène Lupin he muttered Suddenly as if moved by anger he rushed upon his two assistants and shook them violently They did not awaken The devil he cried Can it be possible He leaned over them and in turn examined them,B

There was no evidence to that effect And even if that was so it did not explain the flight of the prisoner That still remained a mystery Amongst twenty theories which sought to explain it not one was satisfactory Of the escape itself there was no doubt an escape that was incomprehensible sensational in which the public as well as the officers of the law could detect a carefully prepared plan a combination of circumstances marvelously dove tailed whereof the dénouement fully justified the confident prediction of Arsène Lupin I shall not be present at my trial After a month,B

he sat for a moment as if thinking and then deliberately re read it slowly and with here and there a pause when at last he handed it back to Brierly he asked Do you understand that letter No more than I do the riddle of the sphinx Ferrars he leaned forward eagerly as he put a question and his eyes were apprehensive though his voice was firm Do you connect that letter in any way with my brother s death For a moment the detective was silent thinking of the newspaper and the missing clipping Then he replied slowly,C

present preoccupation would prove so astute You have not bungled be sure of that You have been most wonderfully keen and clever but it was this very preoccupation as you call it my abnormal sensitiveness in fact which made me study your every word and set me searching for its hidden meaning and so I could not fail to see that you were handling me hedging me about for some purpose Ah You have said the word Brierly Ferrars resumed his seat opposite the other and his tone became once more composed We were trying to hedge you about to,C
host Next morning Mrs Myers declared herself more than ready to leave Glenville The thought of being in a house where an intruder found it so easy to make free with a lady s wardrobe was not pleasant and she hoped Ruth would not ask her to spend another week in the town In fact she only stipulated for a fortnight s visit with her friend Miss Grant upon which Ruth promised that they would really go very soon although she was enjoying herself Three days later a party of the Glenville s guests set off after an early breakfast,C
will tell you that and other things He arose and stood before her I must not tarry now Shall you be at liberty this afternoon I am so sorry I am promised to my hostess She thinks I live too secluded a life But I am about to make a change She brightened visibly as she told of her Surrey prospects and her hope of seeing his party and himself there And then her smile faded I fear I may not see you again for at least a fortnight I have promised Mrs Latham my hostess that I would go,C
looking at it thoughtfully then I should like to retain this he said looking at Brierly as one of the documents in the case And as Brierly silently bowed his assent he added Have you formed an opinion concerning this letter I believe it is a shameful trick declared Robert Brierly hotly An attempt on the part of some person or persons to injure Miss Grant who stands to me as a sister henceforth If I am any judge of womankind she is as good as she is lovely and I believe that she mourns my brother s awful death,C
he mention getting it Doctor Barnes shook his head He said nothing about such a letter he replied Does he know about this this newspaper business Not a word No one knows it but yourself If it should prove to be a clue in my hands it may be better it will be better I am sure to keep it at present between us two I think however that I may decide to show Miss my cousin that anonymous letter and tell her something about that mysterious boy and his visit to her lover s rooms And then Ferrars turned,C

go far afield as is Ferrars You think him skilful None better Then do you know his address Brierly got up and began to walk about his eyes beginning to glow with the excitement so long suppressed Because we can t get him here too soon I agree with you And now one thing more To give him every advantage he should not be known and the inquest should not begin until he is here Can that be managed I think so Brierly was now nervously eager He seemed to have shaken off the stupor which at first had seemed,C
mistaken but I could almost believe that I have found my first clue And yet he had heard nothing and yet all he had seen was a woman s shadow reflected fitfully by the waning moon as she paced her room to and fro to and fro like some restless or tormented animal and now and then lifted her arms aloft in despair in malediction in triumph in entreaty which In spite of his brief rest if rest it was Ferrars was astir before sunrise but even so he found the doctor awake before him and his horse in waiting,C
and had lowered the light over the writing table he put a hand upon the other s shoulder I ll go out with you of course Brierly he said and there was a world of sympathy as well as complete understanding in his tone But first I want to ask you to show yourself as little as possible upon the streets for a few days to come at least and then only in the company of the doctor or myself and not to go out evenings at all unless similarly attended It will be irksome I know but I believe,C
holding the glass she said slowly Then you know me Yes How By your voice a little but mostly by what Mr Ferrars said Mr Ferrars she gasped Do you mean him I mean the man you have called Grant Did you never guess that he was a detective And he knew The woman arose to her full height and again as on a night long since and in another country her arms were tossed above her head as Ruth nodded her answer and for a moment her face was awful to look upon so tortured so despairing so full,C

away from the ancestral history Hilda grown accustomed to his numerous queries and scant explanations was not surprised at Ferrars hurried departure at the end of the catechism and he went back to the doctor s cottage with just one faint little possibility as a reward for all this interviewing He had known Mr Myers in the city as a successful detective is apt to know an able lawyer well by reputation and personally a little and he was glad to find in him a friend to the Brierlys dead and living Going back that night he said to himself,C

under a street lamp I recognised the same man And you have seen him since Himself or another A disguise is easy at night I have been watched at any rate and followed again and again Ah And could you imagine his motive No A look that was almost of anger crossed Brierly s face But I have wondered if it was the same as yours and Myers when you have contrived to keep me from going here and there or doing this or that unless accompanied by one or the other of you two He bent forward again after,C
Go that way Hopkins and we ll keep to the road and meet you at the further end of the mound They separated silently and for some moments Mr Doran and his companions walked on still silent then We ought to have brought that simpleton along Doran said as if meditating The Kramers live only a quarter of a mile beyond the mound and it must have been near here Stop He drew his companions back from the track as a pony s head appeared around a curve of the road and then as a black shetland and low phaeton,C
from this subject to explain to the doctor his present plans How he had determined to continue his masquerade and to remain for a time in Glenville and though Mrs Jamieson s name was not uttered the doctor found himself wondering as had Hilda Grant if the detective had not found the place attractive for personal as well as business reasons and if a detective s heart must needs be of adamant after all Next morning Samuel Doran who knew the detective only as Hilda Grant s cousin and a right good fellow drove ostentatiously to the door to take,C

Robert Brierly standing at the edge of the porch where it joined the wall of the doctor s room I was afraid of this muttered Doctor Barnes But the detective seemed in nowise disconcerted Neither did he seem inclined to listen or allow Brierly to listen to a repetition of Mrs Fry s story You are here just in time Mr Brierly he said briskly Mrs Fry believes that someone has paid a visit to your brother s room during the night and as she says you are the one who should investigate and I think it ought to be,C
I be disappointed in any way Because I fear the claimant we have seen but one is not the person you hoped to find Ferrars actually smiled Describe the person he said Without speaking the lawyer held out to him across the table a visiting card a lady s card correct according to the London mode of the hour and bearing a name which Ferrars read aloud with no sign of emotion in his face Mrs Gaston Latham He looked up with the card still between his fingers Is she the solitary heir No there are two children girls of,C

Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp His absence was strange and inexplicable I remembered Mrs Inglethorp s dying words What lay beneath them What more could she have told us if she had had time At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs Dr Wilkins was looking important and excited and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm Dr Bauerstein remained in the background his grave bearded face unchanged Dr Wilkins was the spokesman for the two He addressed himself to John Mr Cavendish I should like your consent to a post mortem Is that necessary,D
general confusion the boudoir had not been swept that morning and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth The weather had been perfectly fine for some days and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit I strolled to the window and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir and also I learnt from you that they _had_ been planted yesterday afternoon I was now sure that one or possibly both of the gardeners,D
verses in fancy bindings No we re an impecunious lot My mother s always been awfully good to us I must say That is up to now Since her marriage of course he broke off frowning For the first time I felt that with Evelyn Howard something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere Her presence had spelt security Now that security was removed and the air seemed rife with suspicion The sinister face of Dr Bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching,D
swiftly passed out of the little glade leaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone Rather ostentatiously I stepped forward crackling some dead branches with my feet as I did so John turned Luckily he took it for granted that I had only just come upon the scene Hullo Hastings Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage Quaint little chap Is he any good though really He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day Oh well I suppose there must be something in it then What a rotten world,D
I shall never forget it But you are wonderful I understand now What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa Poirot eh But you would not trust me I see everything now said Lawrence The drugged cocoa taken on top of the poisoned coffee amply accounts for the delay Exactly But was the coffee poisoned or was it not We come to a little difficulty here since Mrs Inglethorp never drank it What The cry of surprise was universal No You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs Inglethorp,D
the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance That letter excepted there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime There s only one thing I can t make out why didn t he destroy it at once when he got hold of it Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all that of keeping it on his own person I don t understand Look at it from his point of view I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it the,D
extent Still it is a possibility to be taken into account But according to you she ate very little for supper and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning Now that is a curious circumstance my friend Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it In the meantime remember it As we neared the house John came out and met us His face looked weary and haggard This is a very dreadful business Monsieur Poirot he said Hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity I comprehend perfectly You see it,D
As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him the criminal would be off his guard Now he will be doubly careful Yes doubly careful He turned to me abruptly Tell me Hastings you yourself have you no suspicions of anybody I hesitated To tell the truth an idea wild and extravagant in itself had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain I had rejected it as absurd nevertheless it persisted You couldn t call it a suspicion I murmured It s so utterly foolish Come now urged Poirot encouragingly Do not fear Speak your mind,D
in the coffee brought in seven cups not knowing that Mr Inglethorp never drank it whereas Dorcas who cleared them away the following morning found six as usual or strictly speaking she found five the sixth being the one found broken in Mrs Inglethorp s room I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her coffee My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some salt on the tray of,D
Not that I know of Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand writing carelessly disguised No I do not think so I put it to you that it is your own hand writing No I put it to you that anxious to prove an alibi you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement No Is it not a fact that at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot you were,D
and blotting out the real woman Without a word she turned and went swiftly up the stairs whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence a proceeding of which I for one doubted the wisdom Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments,D
the services of about ten amateur detectives who would be watching him unceasingly and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document He was therefore forced to depart from the house leaving it in the spill vase But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him Yes but Miss Howard did not know of the paper s existence In accordance with their prearranged plan she never spoke to Alfred Inglethorp They were supposed to be deadly enemies and until John Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a,D
up at a time as she dealt with Coot s the Cash Chemists in Tadminster She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post mortem Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death Certainly The supposition is ridiculous The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error That of course is always possible replied the doctor But Dorcas who was the next,D
live here but I shall not You are going to leave him Yes But why She paused a long time and said at last Perhaps because I want to be free And as she spoke I had a sudden vision of broad spaces virgin tracts of forests untrodden lands and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish I seemed to see her for a moment as she was a proud wild creature as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills A little cry broke from her lips You don t,D
tried to be too clever and that was their undoing Poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette his eyes fixed on the ceiling They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish by buying strychnine at the village chemist s and signing the register in his hand writing On Monday Mrs Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine On Monday therefore at six o clock Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and,D
his audience _Messieurs mesdames_ as you all know I was called in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which by the advice of the doctors had been kept locked and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred I found first a fragment of green material second a stain on the carpet near the window still damp thirdly an empty box of bromide powders To take the fragment of green material first I found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room,D
H m yes that might be said John But look here how could he have got at the cocoa That wasn t downstairs No it wasn t I admitted reluctantly And then suddenly a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind I hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also I glanced sideways at him He was frowning perplexedly and I drew a deep breath of relief for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this that Dr Bauerstein might have had an accomplice Yet surely it could not be Surely no woman as beautiful as,D
this imbecile of a man _want_ to be arrested Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression His futile denials would not have convinced a child The Coroner however passed briskly to the next point and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon Pardon me interrupted Alfred Inglethorp you have been misinformed I had no quarrel with my dear wife The whole story is absolutely untrue I was absent from the house the entire afternoon Have you anyone who can testify to that You have my word said Inglethorp haughtily The,D
pause and then Dr Bauerstein drew two keys from his pocket and handed them to John These are the keys of the two rooms I have locked them and in my opinion they would be better kept locked for the present The doctors then departed I had been turning over an idea in my head and I felt that the moment had now come to broach it Yet I was a little chary of doing so John I knew had a horror of any kind of publicity and was an easygoing optimist who preferred never to meet trouble half way,D
of middle age with keen eyes and the typical lawyer s mouth John introduced us both and explained the reason of our presence You will understand Wells he added that this is all strictly private We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind Quite so quite so said Mr Wells soothingly I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest but of course it s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor s certificate Yes I suppose so Clever man Bauerstein Great authority on,D
can tell you that was a surprise to us all There must be more in this affair of Inglethorp s with Mrs Raikes than we thought to make him hold his tongue so persistently What are you going to do now Where are the Scotland Yard fellows Gone down to interview the servants I showed them all our exhibits I am disappointed in Japp He has no method Hullo I said looking out of the window Here s Dr Bauerstein I believe you re right about that man Poirot I don t like him He is clever observed Poirot meditatively,D
visit I will some day if you ask me she promised him smiling That is well If you should need a father confessor madame she started ever so slightly remember Papa Poirot is always at your service She stared at him for a few minutes as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words Then she turned abruptly away Come will you not walk back with us too Monsieur Poirot Enchanted madame All the way to Styles Mary talked fast and feverishly It struck me that in some way she was nervous of Poirot s eyes The weather,D
watch that devil her husband There was no time for more Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good byes The Inglethorps did not appear As the motor drove away Mrs Cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house The colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him Who is that I asked sharply for instinctively I distrusted the man That s Dr Bauerstein said John shortly And who,D
story He never hesitated or faltered It was really almost like a conjuring trick What a steady hand you ve got I remarked I believe I ve only seen your hand shake once On an occasion when I was enraged without doubt observed Poirot with great placidity Yes indeed You were in a towering rage Do you remember It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch case in Mrs Inglethorp s bedroom had been forced You stood by the mantelpiece twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion and your hand shook like a leaf I,D
he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself He wished to be arrested He would then produce his irreproachable alibi and hey presto he was safe for life But I still don t see how he managed to prove his alibi and yet go to the chemist s shop Poirot stared at me in surprise Is it possible My poor friend You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist s shop Miss Howard,D
but recognizable Ah I cried That was what you sealed up in the envelope Yes It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs Inglethorp s own dresses and quite unimportant We shall see Five _this_ With a dramatic gesture he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing table It must have been done since yesterday otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting paper and a hot iron One of my best hats once but that is not to the point It was very likely,D
gratifying but Poirot s next words were not so welcome I must have an ally in the house he observed reflectively You have me I protested True but you are not sufficient I was hurt and showed it Poirot hurried to explain himself You do not quite take my meaning You are known to be working with me I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way Oh I see How about John No I think not The dear fellow isn t perhaps very bright I said thoughtfully Here comes Miss Howard said Poirot suddenly She is,D
are refugees from their native land We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man He was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity His head was exactly the shape of an egg and he always perched it a little on one side His moustache was very stiff and military The neatness of his attire was almost incredible I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound Yet this quaint dandified little man who I was sorry to see now limped,D
pleased with me _mon ami _ My dear Poirot I said coldly it is not for me to dictate to you You have a right to your own opinion just as I have to mine A most admirable sentiment remarked Poirot rising briskly to his feet Now I have finished with this room By the way whose is the smaller desk in the corner Mr Inglethorp s Ah He tried the roll top tentatively Locked But perhaps one of Mrs Inglethorp s keys would open it He tried several twisting and turning them with a practiced hand and finally uttering,D
appeared to be in an absolute frenzy My dear Poirot I expostulated I never thought it would interest you I didn t know it was of any importance Importance It is of the first importance So Dr Bauerstein was here on Tuesday night the night of the murder Hastings do you not see That alters everything everything I had never seen him so upset Loosening his hold of me he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks still murmuring to himself Yes that alters everything everything Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision _Allons _ he said We must act,D
that is not there We examine We search And that little curious fact that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally we put it here He made an extravagant gesture with his hand It is significant It is tremendous Y es Ah Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it Beware Peril to the detective who says It is so small it does not matter It will not agree I will forget it That way lies confusion Everything matters I know You always told me that That s why I have gone into all,D
at his watch I wonder if we ve time to pick up Cynthia No she ll have started from the hospital by now Cynthia That s not your wife No Cynthia is a protégée of my mother s the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor He came a cropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless My mother came to the rescue and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster seven miles away As he spoke the last words we drew,D
that settles it And Poirot looked crestfallen I could not help rejoicing that for once one of his little ideas had come to naught After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home I consented rather stiffly You are annoyed is it not so he asked anxiously as we walked through the park Not at all I said coldly That is well That lifts a great load from my mind This was not quite what I had intended I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner Still the fervour of his words went towards the,D
Cavendish was actually in the deceased s room when the alarm was given I shot a quick glance at Mary She was very pale but smiling I proceeded to reason on that assumption Mrs Cavendish is in her mother in law s room We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it Suddenly Mrs Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm She flings out her arm overturning the bed table and then pulls desperately at the bell Mrs Cavendish startled drops her candle scattering the grease on the carpet She picks it,D
in his arms he kissed me warmly on both cheeks and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room Mary Cavendish entered at that moment What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot He rushed past me crying out A garage For the love of Heaven direct me to a garage madame And before I could answer he had dashed out into the street I hurried to the window True enough there he was tearing down the street hatless and gesticulating as he went I turned to Mary with a gesture of despair He ll be stopped,D
but and this is significant I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing He looked at Mary Cavendish Am I right madame She bowed her head Quite right monsieur You understand that if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts I would have done so But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence In a sense that is correct madame But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions and left me free to see other facts in their true,D
he sent her downstairs to the dining room for brandy Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor I turned to Lawrence to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services but the words were frozen on my lips Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man s face He was white as chalk the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet and his eyes petrified with terror or some such kindred emotion stared,D
talks One of them Belgies from the village Yes I said eagerly He has been here then Oh ay he s been here right enough More n once too Friend of yours is he Ah you gentlemen from the Hall you m a pretty lot And he leered more jocosely than ever Why do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often I asked as carelessly as I could He winked at me knowingly _One_ does mister Naming no names mind And a very liberal gentleman too Oh thank you sir I m sure I walked on sharply Evelyn Howard,D
Coroner did not trouble to reply There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your disagreement with Mrs Inglethorp Those witnesses were mistaken I was puzzled The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered I looked at Poirot There was an expression of exultation on his face which I could not understand Was he at last convinced of Alfred Inglethorp s guilt Mr Inglethorp said the Coroner you have heard your wife s dying words repeated here Can you explain them in any way Certainly I can You can It seems to me very simple,D
take the coffee into the boudoir the proceedings were adjourned until the following day As we went home Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel That hateful man What a net he has drawn around my poor John How he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn t Well I said consolingly it will be the other way about to morrow Yes she said meditatively then suddenly dropped her voice Mr Hastings you do not think surely it could not have been Lawrence Oh no that could not be But I myself was puzzled,D
and the adjoining one occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance Nor did they recognize it for what it was a piece torn from a green land armlet There was a little stir of excitement Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land Mrs Cavendish Therefore it must have been Mrs Cavendish who entered the deceased s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle Cynthia s room But that door was bolted on the inside I cried When I examined the room,D
have preferred to work in the dark just for the present but what you say is very just the word of a Belgian policeman whose day is past is not enough And Alfred Inglethorp must not be arrested That I have sworn as my friend Hastings here knows See then my good Japp you go at once to Styles Well in about half an hour We re seeing the Coroner and the doctor first Good Call for me in passing the last house in the village I will go with you At Styles Mr Inglethorp will give you or if,D
front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant It was going to be a hot day Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary a curious mingling of terror and agitation Look Poirot I said He leant forward _Tiens _ he said It is Mr Mace from the chemist s shop He is coming here The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage and,D
If I choose You defy me No but I deny your right to criticize my actions Have _you_ no friends of whom I should disapprove John fell back a pace The colour ebbed slowly from his face What do you mean he said in an unsteady voice You see said Mary quietly You _do_ see don t you that _you_ have no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends John glanced at her pleadingly a stricken look on his face No right Have I _no_ right Mary he said unsteadily He stretched out his hands,D
in and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London I was dumbfounded What on earth could Poirot be doing in London Was it a sudden decision on his part or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance With Poirot away I was uncertain how to act Had he foreseen this arrest Had he not in all probability been the cause of it Those questions I could not resolve But in the meantime,D
can t last for ever Can t it though It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again No no you re getting morbid on the subject Enough to make a man morbid to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon faced idiots wherever he goes But there s worse than that What John lowered his voice Have you ever thought Hastings it s a nightmare to me who did it I can t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident Because because who could have,D
said with a sigh I think you have explained everything I am glad it has all ended so happily Even John and his wife are reconciled Thanks to me How do you mean thanks to you My dear friend do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again That John Cavendish still loved his wife I was convinced Also that she was equally in love with him But they had drifted very far apart It all arose from a misunderstanding She married him without love He knew it He is a,D
to say this to him I have a message for you from Poirot He says Find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace Nothing more Nothing less Find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace Is that right I asked much mystified Excellent But what does it mean Ah that I will leave you to find out You have access to the facts Just say that to him and see what he says Very well but it s all extremely mysterious We were running into Tadminster now and Poirot directed the car to the,D
to see the lady s bedroom please and after that I ll have a little chat with the servants Don t you bother about anything Mr Poirot here will show me the way As they all went out of the room Poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs There he caught me by the arm and drew me aside Quick go to the other wing Stand there just this side of the baize door Do not move till I come Then turning rapidly he rejoined the two detectives I followed his instructions taking up my position,D
where women are concerned but I remembered certain evidences too lightly thought of at the time perhaps but which certainly seemed to indicate My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper This she handed to Poirot murmuring as she did so the cryptic words On top of the wardrobe Then she hurriedly left the room Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction He spread it out,D
endeavoured to interrupt but Poirot swept on Let me tell you this Hastings She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp her husband be arrested _now_ when a word from me could save him CHAPTER VI THE INQUEST In the interval before the inquest Poirot was unfailing in his activity Twice he was closeted with Mr Wells He also took long walks into the country I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at It occurred to me that he might,D
afternoon With a groan Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hands Poirot approached and stood over him Speak he cried menacingly With an effort Inglethorp raised his face from his hands Then slowly and deliberately he shook his head You will not speak No I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say Poirot nodded thoughtfully like a man whose mind is made up _Soit _ he said Then I must speak for you Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again You How can you speak You do,D
in search of Dorcas When I returned with her however the boudoir was empty Poirot I cried where are you I am here my friend He had stepped outside the French window and was standing apparently lost in admiration before the various shaped flower beds Admirable he murmured Admirable What symmetry Observe that crescent and those diamonds their neatness rejoices the eye The spacing of the plants also is perfect It has been recently done is it not so Yes I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon But come in Dorcas is here _Eh bien eh bien _ Do,D
is a very ordinary lock Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it We stared at one another blankly Poirot had walked over to the mantelpiece He was outwardly calm but I noticed his hands which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantelpiece were shaking violently See here it was like this he said at last There was something in that case some piece of evidence slight in itself perhaps but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime It was vital to him that,D
for there were two sets of footprints in the bed had entered the boudoir for if Mrs Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window and they would not have come into the room at all I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature Events proved that I was right in my supposition That was very ingenious I could not help admitting I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words,D
head It s an awkward position for all of us Of course one has to treat him as usual but hang it all one s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer Poirot nodded sympathetically I quite understand It is a very difficult situation for you Mr Cavendish I would like to ask you one question Mr Inglethorp s reason for not returning last night was I believe that he had forgotten the latch key Is not that so Yes I suppose you are quite sure that the latch key _was_ forgotten that he did,D
it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated Therefore he took the risk the great risk of coming in here Finding the case locked he was obliged to force it thus betraying his presence For him to take that risk it must have been something of great importance But what was it Ah cried Poirot with a gesture of anger That I do not know A document of some kind without doubt possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon And I his anger burst forth freely miserable animal that I am,D
face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia was in love with Monsieur John When he entered his mother s room and saw her obviously poisoned he jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter He was nearly driven desperate First he crushed the coffee cup to powder under his feet remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night before and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents Thenceforward he strenuously and quite uselessly,D
time Yes I understand continued the Coroner deliberately that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir That is so is it not This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot I fancied that it was news to him as well There was the faintest pause the mere hesitation of a moment before she answered Yes that is so And the boudoir window was open was it not Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered Yes Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside especially as,D
I added with belated recognition Yes but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won t disguise Well we ve only his word for that And there are other possibilities He s admittedly one of the world s greatest toxicologists One of the world s greatest what Say it again He knows more about poisons than almost anybody I explained Well my idea is that perhaps he s found some way of making strychnine tasteless Or it may not have been strychnine at all but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of which produces much the same symptoms,D
at the inquest We went slowly upstairs again I was opening my lips when Poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand Not now not now _mon ami_ I have need of reflection My mind is in some disorder which is not well For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence perfectly still except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener At last he heaved a deep sigh It is well The bad moment has passed Now all is arranged and classified One must never permit confusion The case,D
Poirot studied her seriously Miss Howard I will ask you one question I beg of you to reply to it truthfully Never tell lies replied Miss Howard It is this Do you still believe that Mrs Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband What do you mean she asked sharply You needn t think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest I ll admit that it wasn t he who bought strychnine at the chemist s shop What of that I dare say he soaked fly paper as I told you at the beginning That is arsenic not strychnine said,D
Cavendishes but she was not their own mother Blood tells always remember that blood tells Poirot I said I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if Mrs Inglethorp ate well last night I have been turning it over in my mind but I can t see how it has anything to do with the matter He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along but finally he said I do not mind telling you though as you know it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached The present contention,D

by the baize door and wondering what on earth lay behind the request Why was I to stand in this particular spot on guard I looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me An idea struck me With the exception of Cynthia Murdoch s everyone s room was in this left wing Had that anything to do with it Was I to report who came or went I stood faithfully at my post The minutes passed Nobody came Nothing happened It must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me You have not stirred No I ve stuck,D
been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson s The quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated His learned friend Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr Philips had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he and not Mr Inglethorp who had been the participator in the quarrel He thought the,D
Lots of parcels come Can t remember one special one You do not know if it was sent after Mr Lawrence Cavendish to Wales or whether it was put in his room Don t think it was sent after him Should have remembered it if it was Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr Lawrence Cavendish and afterwards it disappeared should you remark its absence No don t think so I should think someone had taken charge of it I believe Miss Howard that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper He held up the same dusty,D
Yes time is an advantage if if there has been foul play Rubbish cried Lawrence angrily In my opinion the whole thing is a mare s nest of Bauerstein s Wilkins hadn t an idea of such a thing until Bauerstein put it into his head But like all specialists Bauerstein s got a bee in his bonnet Poisons are his hobby so of course he sees them everywhere I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence s attitude He was so seldom vehement about anything John hesitated I can t feel as you do Lawrence he said at last,D
being silly I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife To my intense surprise Cynthia burst out laughing and called me a funny dear It s perfectly sweet of you she said but you know you don t want to Yes I do I ve got Never mind what you ve got You don t really want to and I don t either Well of course that settles it I said stiffly But I don t see anything to laugh at There s nothing funny about a proposal No indeed said Cynthia Somebody might accept,D
a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and Cynthia agreeing I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet Mrs Cavendish was coming down the stairs It may have been my fancy but she too was looking odd and disturbed Had a good walk with Dr Bauerstein I asked trying to appear as indifferent as I could I didn t go she replied abruptly Where is Mrs Inglethorp In the boudoir Her hand clenched itself on the banisters then she seemed to nerve herself for some encounter,D
sound of the bell below She had started up Poirot had opened the door and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently Yes madame he said I have brought him back to you He had stood aside and as I went out I had seen the look in Mary s eyes as John Cavendish had caught his wife in his arms Perhaps you are right Poirot I said gently Yes it is the greatest thing in the world Suddenly there was a tap at the door and Cynthia peeped in I I only Come in I said springing up She,D
that she had not finished She began slowly walking up and down the room her head a little bent and that slim supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked She stopped suddenly and looked up at me You don t know anything about me do you she asked Where I come from who I was before I married John anything in fact Well I will tell you I will make a father confessor of you You are kind I think yes I am sure you are kind Somehow I was not quite as elated as I might have,D
really a matter of great difficulty There were no red eyes no signs of secretly indulged grief I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy I pass over Alfred Inglethorp who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy Did he know that we suspected him I wondered Surely he could not be unaware of the fact conceal it as we would Did he feel some secret stirring of fear or was he confident that his crime,D
Mrs Inglethorp s room She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion She turned towards me and gasped out Alfred Alfred Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs Inglethorp s after dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband Possibly but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed It is retarded under certain conditions none of which however appear to have been present in this case I presume Mrs Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o clock whereas,D
that you yourself poured out the coffee and took it to your wife that evening I poured it out yes But I did not take it to her I meant to do so but I was told that a friend was at the hall door so I laid down the coffee on the hall table When I came through the hall again a few minutes later it was gone This statement might or might not be true but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for Inglethorp In any case he had had ample time to introduce,D
but she answered How dare you I have kept you and clothed you and fed you You owe everything to me And this is how you repay me By bringing disgrace upon our name Again I didn t hear what he said but she went on Nothing that you can say will make any difference I see my duty clearly My mind is made up You need not think that any fear of publicity or scandal between husband and wife will deter me Then I thought I heard them coming out so I went off quickly You are sure it,D
tell you I have an idea that I was out walking In what direction I really can t remember The Coroner s face grew graver Were you in company with anyone No Did you meet anyone on your walk No That is a pity said the Coroner dryly I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr Mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine If you like to take it that way yes Be careful Mr Inglethorp Poirot was fidgeting nervously _Sacré _ he murmured Does,D
topic of the moment Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes The house was constantly besieged by reporters who were consistently denied admission but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds where they lay in wait with cameras for any unwary members of the household We all lived in a blast of publicity The Scotland Yard men came and went examining questioning lynx eyed and reserved of tongue Towards what end they were working we did not know Had they any clue or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes After breakfast Dorcas,D
recalling unpleasant memories but I have a little idea Poirot s little ideas were becoming a perfect byword and would like to ask one or two questions Of me Certainly You are too amiable madame What I want to ask is this the door leading into Mrs Inglethorp s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia it was bolted you say Certainly it was bolted replied Mary Cavendish rather surprised I said so at the inquest Bolted Yes She looked perplexed I mean explained Poirot you are sure it was bolted and not merely locked Oh I see what you mean,D
And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will She might have burnt the new one mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour She is so terribly bitter against him You consider her vehemence unnatural Y es She is so very violent I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point Poirot shook his head energetically No no you are on a wrong tack there There is nothing weak minded or degenerate about Miss Howard She is an excellent specimen of well balanced English beef and brawn She is sanity,D
of Friday That will give us plenty of time for the doctor s report The post mortem is to take place to night I believe Yes Then that arrangement will suit you Perfectly I need not tell you my dear Cavendish how distressed I am at this most tragic affair Can you give us no help in solving it monsieur interposed Poirot speaking for the first time since we had entered the room I Yes we heard that Mrs Inglethorp wrote to you last night You should have received the letter this morning I did but it contains no information,D
facts had been misrepresented What had actually occurred was this The prisoner returning to the house on Tuesday evening had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr and Mrs Inglethorp No suspicion had entered the prisoner s head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr Inglethorp He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two quarrels The prosecution averred that on Monday July 16th the prisoner had entered the chemist s shop in the village disguised as Mr Inglethorp The prisoner on the contrary was at that time at a,D
not take it after all I have no idea I never thought of looking We always keep it in the hall drawer I ll go and see if it s there now Poirot held up his hand with a faint smile No no Mr Cavendish it is too late now I am certain that you would find it If Mr Inglethorp did take it he has had ample time to replace it by now But do you think I think nothing If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return and seen it there it would have been,D
eyes different from any other woman s that I have ever known the intense power of stillness she possessed which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body all these things are burnt into my memory I shall never forget them She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John s invitation Mrs Cavendish gave me some tea and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating,D

salt I remarked sceptically All these wills are very confusing Tell me how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon Poirot smiled _Mon ami_ have you ever when writing a letter been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word Yes often I suppose everyone has Exactly And have you not in such a case tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting paper or a spare scrap of paper to see if it looked right Well that,D
Scott You _were_ right then I couldn t believe it at the time No it is astonishing until you get used to the idea and see how it makes everything fit in Now what are we to do Of course it will be generally known to morrow John reflected Never mind he said at last we won t say anything at present There is no need As you say it will be known soon enough But to my intense surprise on getting down early the next morning and eagerly opening the newspapers there was not a word about the arrest,D
and took it in I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement Unknown to herself Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence How she would have gaped if she had realized that her coarse kitchen salt was strychnine one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind I marvelled at Poirot s calm His self control was astonishing I awaited his next question with impatience but it disappointed me When you went into Mrs Inglethorp s room was the door leading into Miss Cynthia s room bolted Oh Yes sir it always was It had never,D
Mrs Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards At six o clock Miss Howard disguised as Alfred Inglethorp enters the chemist s shop with her story about a dog obtains the strychnine and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John s handwriting which she had previously studied carefully But as it will never do if John too can prove an alibi she writes him an anonymous note still copying his hand writing which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him So far all goes well Miss Howard goes,D
he shook his head decidedly No my friend Oh look here why not Two is enough for a secret Well I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me I am not keeping back facts Every fact that I know is in your possession You can draw your own deductions from them This time it is a question of ideas Still it would be interesting to know Poirot looked at me very earnestly and again shook his head You see he said sadly _you_ have no instincts It was intelligence you were requiring just now I pointed,D
and Cynthia interrupted But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room Not if you were drugged mademoiselle Drugged _Mais oui _ You remember he addressed us collectively again that through all the tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept That admitted of two possibilities Either her sleep was feigned which I did not believe or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means With this latter idea in my mind I examined all the coffee cups most carefully remembering that it was Mrs Cavendish who had brought Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before I,D
didn t have a candle only a reading lamp Then if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor you think you would have been sure to have seen it Yes sir and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting paper and a hot iron Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas Did your mistress ever have a green dress No sir Nor a mantle nor a cape nor a how do you call it a sports coat Not green sir Nor anyone else in the house Annie reflected,D
I am sorry you were not here in time to witness them They were quite tetanic in character Ah said Dr Wilkins wisely I should like to speak to you in private said Dr Bauerstein He turned to John You do not object Certainly not We all trooped out into the corridor leaving the two doctors alone and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us We went slowly down the stairs I was violently excited I have a certain talent for deduction and Dr Bauerstein s manner had started a flock of wild surmises in my mind,D
is what Mrs Inglethorp did You will notice that the word possessed is spelt first with one s and subsequently with two correctly To make sure she had further tried it in a sentence thus I am possessed Now what did that tell me It told me that Mrs Inglethorp had been writing the word possessed that afternoon and having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind the possibility of a will a document almost certain to contain that word occurred to me at once This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance In the,D
in Yorkshire She shuddered You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been The narrowness the deadly monotony of it almost drove me mad She paused a minute and added in a different tone And then I met John Cavendish Yes You can imagine that from my aunts point of view it was a very good match for me But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me No he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my,D
do wish I knew what it was all about I thought of Mrs Raikes s gipsy face and Evelyn Howard s warnings but wisely decided to hold my peace whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis and cheerfully hoped Aunt Emily will send him away and will never speak to him again I was anxious to get hold of John but he was nowhere to be seen Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon I tried to forget the few words I had overheard but do what I would I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind What was,D
enigmatical Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity Our eyes met Poirot s were pleasantly vague He got up and hummed a little tune I watched him suspiciously Poirot I said what was in this particular little bottle Poirot looked out of the window Hydro chloride of strychnine he said over his shoulder continuing to hum Good heavens I said it quite quietly I was not surprised I had expected that answer They use the pure hydro chloride of strychnine very little only occasionally for pills It is the,D

wise one Well he said at last let us go _mon ami_ You have finished here For the moment yes You will walk back with me to the village Willingly He picked up his little suit case and we went out through the open window in the drawing room Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in and Poirot stood aside to let her pass Excuse me mademoiselle one minute Yes she turned inquiringly Did you ever make up Mrs Inglethorp s medicines A slight flush rose in her face as she answered rather constrainedly No Only her powders The flush deepened,D

so was able to see them continually As the weeks went by the state of Poirot s nerves grew worse and worse That last link he talked about was still lacking Privately I hoped it might remain so for what happiness could there be for Mary if John were not acquitted On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey charged with The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp and pleaded Not Guilty Sir Ernest Heavywether the famous K C had been engaged to defend him Mr Philips K C opened the case for the Crown,D
most plausible stories Far more convincing than Mr Inglethorp s stony denials I could not help laughing My dear Poirot I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy But seriously in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp s innocence Why not now as much as before Nothing has changed But the evidence is so conclusive Yes too conclusive We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage and proceeded up the now familiar stairs Yes yes too conclusive continued Poirot almost to himself,D
her hand I don t know if it was a letter or just a piece of paper but it had writing on it and she kept staring at it almost as if she couldn t believe what was written there She whispered to herself as though she had forgotten I was there These few words and everything s changed And then she says to me Never trust a man Dorcas they re not worth it I hurried off and got her a good strong cup of tea and she thanked me and said she d feel better when she d,D
morning and there was no sign of the Scotland Yard men But at lunch time there arrived a new piece of evidence or rather lack of evidence We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter which Mrs Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death Our efforts having been in vain we had abandoned the matter hoping that it might turn up of itself one day And this is just what did happen in the shape of a communication which arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers acknowledging Mrs Inglethorp s cheque and,D
can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution Which one The one that relates to the destruction of the will John Cavendish did not destroy that will Poirot was a true prophet I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings as it involves many tiresome repetitions I will merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence and was duly committed for trial September found us all in London Mary took a house in Kensington Poirot being included in the family party I myself had been given a job at the War Office,D

friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building just outside Mrs Cavendish s door I myself in company with the police went to the deceased s room and whilst there I apparently accidentally knocked over the table in question but found that as I had expected Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all This confirmed my belief that Mrs Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy In fact I was convinced that far from having been in her own room Mrs,D
wife she was the late Lord Abbotsbury s daughter does the same She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy We are quite a war household nothing is wasted here every scrap of waste paper even is saved and sent away in sacks I expressed my appreciation and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase which forked right and left half way to different wings of the building My room was in the left wing and looked out over the park John left me and a few minutes later I saw him,D

to keep up the place all right I asked Oh yes There are the death duties of course but half my father s money goes with the place and Lawrence will stay with us for the present so there is his share as well We shall be pinched at first of course because as I once told you I am in a bit of a hole financially myself Still the Johnnies will wait now In the general relief at Inglethorp s approaching departure we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy Cynthia whose young spirits were,D

witness called dispelled even that possibility The medicine had not been newly made up On the contrary Mrs Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned and the Coroner proceeded with his task Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress s bell and had subsequently roused the household he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon Dorcas s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had already heard so I will,D

intervening weeks I will say little but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish She ranged herself passionately on her husband s side scorning the mere idea of his guilt and fought for him tooth and nail I expressed my admiration to Poirot and he nodded thoughtfully Yes she is of those women who show at their best in adversity It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them Her pride and her jealousy have Jealousy I queried Yes Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman As I was saying her,D

I restrained my tongue After all though he was old Poirot had been a great man in his day Breakfast is ready said John Cavendish coming in from the hall You will breakfast with us Monsieur Poirot Poirot acquiesced I observed John Already he was almost restored to his normal self The shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal He was a man of very little imagination in sharp contrast with his brother who had perhaps too much Ever since the early hours of the,D

never have suspected them of being official personages I was still staring when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown CHAPTER VII POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS As we came out of the Stylites Arms Poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm I understood his object He was waiting for the Scotland Yard men In a few moments they emerged and Poirot at once stepped forward and accosted the shorter of the two I fear you do not remember me Inspector Japp Why if it isn,D
of the contents of the bottle Certainly not Then why did you take it up I once studied to be a doctor Such things naturally interest me Ah So poisons naturally interest you do they Still you waited to be alone before gratifying that interest of yours That was pure chance If the others had been there I should have done just the same Still as it happens the others were not there No but In fact during the whole afternoon you were only alone for a couple of minutes and it happened I say it happened to be during,D
to do scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing At four o clock she has been angry but completely mistress of herself At five o clock she is in violent distress and speaks of having had a great shock Looking at the matter psychologically I drew one deduction which I was convinced was correct The second scandal she spoke of was not the same as the first and it concerned herself Let us reconstruct At four o clock Mrs Inglethorp quarrels with her son and threatens to denounce him to his wife who by the way overheard the,D
doing on it He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there Oh yes he did Impossible We were all together the whole time Poirot shook his head No my friend there was a moment when you were not all together There was a moment when you could not have been all together or it would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony I d forgotten that I admitted But it was only for a moment Long enough Long enough for what Poirot s smile became rather,D
with you I m sure Cynthia hesitated a moment plucking up the grass with her tiny hands Then she said Mrs Cavendish does She hates me Hates you I cried astonished Cynthia nodded Yes I don t know why but she can t bear me and _he_ can t either There I know you re wrong I said warmly On the contrary John is very fond of you Oh yes _John_ I meant Lawrence Not of course that I care whether Lawrence hates me or not Still it s rather horrid when no one loves you isn t it But,D
regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs So the last hope of solving the mystery by means of Mrs Inglethorp s correspondence on the fatal evening had to be abandoned Just before tea I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new disappointment but found to my annoyance that he was once more out Gone to London again Oh no monsieur he has but taken the train to Tadminster To see a young lady s dispensary he said Silly ass I ejaculated I told him Wednesday was the one day she wasn t there,D
to Cynthia was rather constrained and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him But they were both gay enough this afternoon and chatted together like a couple of children As we drove through the village I remembered that I wanted some stamps so accordingly we pulled up at the post office As I came out again I cannoned into a little man who was just entering I drew aside and apologised when suddenly with a loud exclamation he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly _Mon ami_ Hastings he cried It is indeed,D
on the night of the murder Yes my friend said Poirot unexpectedly we can One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working Well Well I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday and that a convoy coming in unexpectedly she had kindly offered to remain on night duty which offer was gratefully accepted That disposes of that Oh I said rather nonplussed Really I continued it s her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her I can t help feeling she d do anything against him,D
is that Mrs Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning presumably administered in her coffee Yes Well what time was the coffee served About eight o clock Therefore she drank it between then and half past eight certainly not much later Well strychnine is a fairly rapid poison Its effects would be felt very soon probably in about an hour Yet in Mrs Inglethorp s case the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o clock the next morning nine hours But a heavy meal taken at about the same time as the poison might retard its effects though hardly to that,D
a celebrity unawares I replied And for the rest of the way home I recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot We arrived back in a very cheerful mood As we entered the hall Mrs Inglethorp came out of her boudoir She looked flushed and upset Oh it s you she said Is there anything the matter Aunt Emily asked Cynthia Certainly not said Mrs Inglethorp sharply What should there be Then catching sight of Dorcas the parlourmaid going into the dining room she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir Yes m,D
and Miss Howard were in custody Now at last I had Poirot to myself and could relieve my still burning curiosity Poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said I did not deceive you _mon ami_ At most I permitted you to deceive yourself Yes but why Well it is difficult to explain You see my friend you have a nature so honest and a countenance so transparent that _enfin_ to conceal your feelings is impossible If I had told you my ideas the very first time you saw Mr Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman,D
he could not say She was an old lady and might possibly have forgotten the former one or this seemed to him more likely she may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage as there had been some conversation on the subject Ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge She had about a year before executed a will in favour of the prisoner He would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night Later in the evening he had sought admission,D
of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger prints of any object in a very short space of time Well my friend you have seen the finger marks it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left Go on I am really excited _Eh bien _ Photo No 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster which sounds like the house that Jack built Good heavens I exclaimed But what were Lawrence Cavendish s finger marks,D

but with no effect It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside The whole household was aroused by now The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room Clearly something must be done Try going through Mr Inglethorp s room sir cried Dorcas Oh the poor mistress Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us that he alone had given no sign of his presence John opened the door of his room It was pitch dark but Lawrence was following with the candle and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had,D
Would the prisoner in the hottest week of a hot summer be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing Yes or no No In that case is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence I should not think it likely But it is possible Yes That is all More evidence followed Evidence as to the financial difficulties in which the prisoner had found himself at the end of July Evidence as to his intrigue with Mrs Raikes poor,D

Well tell him to look us up to morrow morning will you Certainly monsieur But on the following day no sign of Poirot I was getting angry He was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion After lunch Lawrence drew me aside and asked if I was going down to see him No I don t think I shall He can come up here if he wants to see us Oh Lawrence looked indeterminate Something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity What is it I asked I could go if there s anything special It,D
How do you know that letter came from Styles Did you notice the postmark No but Ah you did _not_ notice the postmark And yet you affirm so confidently that it came from Styles It might in fact have been any postmark Y es In fact the letter though written on stamped notepaper might have been posted from anywhere From Wales for instance The witness admitted that such might be the case and Sir Ernest signified that he was satisfied Elizabeth Wells second housemaid at Styles stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted,D
on Tuesday morning With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy Poirot led the way back to the morning room See you one should not ask for outside proof no reason should be enough But the flesh is weak it is consolation to find that one is on the right track Ah my friend I am like a giant refreshed I run I leap And in very truth run and leap he did gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window What is your remarkable little friend doing asked a voice behind me and I turned to find,D
do you poison I asked smiling Cynthia smiled too Oh hundreds she said Cynthia called Mrs Inglethorp do you think you could write a few notes for me Certainly Aunt Emily She jumped up promptly and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one and that Mrs Inglethorp kind as she might be in the main did not allow her to forget it My hostess turned to me John will show you your room Supper is at half past seven We have given up late dinner for some time now Lady Tadminster our Member s,D
good deal that was peculiar came out to day continued Poirot Dr Bauerstein now what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact He has insomnia I believe I said doubtfully Which is a very good or a very bad explanation remarked Poirot It covers everything and explains nothing I shall keep my eye on our clever Dr Bauerstein Any more faults to find with the evidence I inquired satirically _Mon ami_ replied Poirot gravely when you find that people are not telling you,D
to her room on which occasion no doubt he found an opportunity of destroying the will which as far as he knew would render the one in his favour valid The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery in his room by Detective Inspector Japp a most brilliant officer of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist s to the supposed Mr Inglethorp on the day before the murder It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner s guilt,D
been foul play to bring the murderer to justice Amen to that said Dorcas fiercely And naming no names there s _one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide And an ill day it was when first _he_ darkened the threshold Poirot waited for her indignation to subside and then resuming his business like tone he asked Now as to this quarrel What is the first you heard of it Well sir I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday What time was that I couldn t say exactly sir but it wasn t tea,D
certainly isn t a J Good replied Poirot folding up the paper again I also am of your way of thinking It is an L depend upon it Where did it come from I asked curiously Is it important Moderately so It confirms a surmise of mine Having deduced its existence I set Miss Howard to search for it and as you see she has been successful What did she mean by On the top of the wardrobe She meant replied Poirot promptly that she found it on top of a wardrobe A funny place for a piece of brown,D
more lying rumours should be started Between you and me sir remarked Japp I d sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same And if it hadn t been for Mr Poirot here arrested you would have been as sure as eggs is eggs I was foolish no doubt murmured Inglethorp But you do not know inspector how I have been persecuted and maligned And he shot a baleful glance at Evelyn Howard Now sir said Japp turning briskly to John I should like,D
door Eh Monsieur Lawrence called Poirot We must congratulate you is it not so Lawrence blushed and then smiled awkwardly A man in love is a sorry spectacle Now Cynthia had looked charming I sighed What is it _mon ami _ Nothing I said sadly They are two delightful women And neither of them is for you finished Poirot Never mind Console yourself my friend We may hunt together again who knows And then THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES Updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed,D
as the key that had originally stood in the lock into his own pocket I have no authority to go through these papers But it should be done at once He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash stand Crossing the room to the left hand window a round stain hardly visible on the dark brown carpet seemed to interest him particularly He went down on his knees examining it minutely even going so far as to smell it Finally he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube sealing it up,D

only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done Some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia s room Possibly she applied oil to the hinges for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time She dressed completely in her land kit and made her way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia s room into that of Mrs Inglethorp He paused a moment,D

it isn t too delightful to see you again Mr Hastings after all these years Alfred darling Mr Hastings my husband I looked with some curiosity at Alfred darling He certainly struck a rather alien note I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen He wore gold rimmed pince nez and had a curious impassivity of feature It struck me that he might look natural on a stage but was strangely out of place in real life His voice was rather deep and unctuous He placed,D
lonely spot called Marston s Spinney where he had been summoned by an anonymous note couched in blackmailing terms and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands The prisoner had accordingly gone to the appointed spot and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home Unfortunately he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story but luckily he had kept the note and it would be produced as evidence As for the statement relating to the destruction of,D
be shielding Alfred Inglethorp Yet that is what it looks like Poirot nodded reflectively Yes it is queer One thing is certain she overheard a good deal more of that private conversation than she was willing to admit And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop Exactly One thing her evidence _has_ shown me I made a mistake Dorcas was quite right The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon about four o clock as she said I looked at him curiously I had never understood his insistence on that point Yes a,D

There was a column of mere padding about The Styles Poisoning Case but nothing further It was rather inexplicable but I supposed that for some reason or other Japp wished to keep it out of the papers It worried me just a little for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come After breakfast I decided to go down to the village and see if Poirot had returned yet but before I could start a well known face blocked one of the windows and the well known voice said _Bonjour mon ami _ Poirot I exclaimed,D
said Poirot genially I suppose Mr Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs when he was Shah of Persia He did have a beard sir replied Dorcas smiling And well I know it for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with And I m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance I didn t know as there was a beard up there at all It must have been got quite lately I think There was a red wig I know but nothing else in the way of hair Burnt corks they,D

you next time Good bye you ve cheered me up _very_ much And with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment she vanished through the trees Thinking over the interview it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village and look up Bauerstein Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow At the same time it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected I remembered how Poirot had relied on my diplomacy Accordingly I went to the little house with,D
questions further but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible and we all turned to the window as it swept past Evie cried John Excuse me Wells He went hurriedly out into the hall Poirot looked inquiringly at me Miss Howard I explained Ah I am glad she has come There is a woman with a head and a heart too Hastings Though the good God gave her no beauty I followed John s example and went out into the hall where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that,D
jumping to the conclusions we did Still there it is we were in the wrong and now there s a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends which is difficult when one doesn t like the fellow a bit better than one did before The whole thing s damned awkward And I m thankful he s had the tact to take himself off It s a good thing Styles wasn t the mater s to leave to him Couldn t bear to think of the fellow lording it here He s welcome to her money You ll be able,D

that the final proof the last link of the chain is now in my hands Amid breathless excitement he held out three thin strips of paper A letter in the murderer s own hand writing _mes amis _ Had it been a little clearer in its terms it is possible that Mrs Inglethorp warned in time would have escaped As it was she realized her danger but not the manner of it In the deathly silence Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and clearing his throat read Dearest Evelyn You will be anxious at hearing nothing It is all,D

It might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan Lawrence on the other hand being less conventional and having more imagination I felt I might count upon as an ally There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead John I said I am going to ask you something Well You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot The Belgian who is here He has been a most famous detective Yes I want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter What now Before the post mortem,D
had been right then and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust as I thought of Alfred Inglethorp s liberality with another woman s money Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime or was it the baser mainspring of money Probably a judicious mixture of both On one point Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession He once or twice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel He suggested to her repeatedly that it was four thirty and not four o clock when,D

I manage to do it without concentration at all I mean that my eyes seem to do it without the brain consciously taking any part I could look at the tray for instance and talk to you about golf at the same time and still get my list right I should think that s rather a useful gift for an amateur detective You ought to have gone into the profession before Well it is rather useful It s rather surprising you know to a stranger Let s surprise Cayley with it shall we How Well let s ask him Antony,E
think Mark always answered them As far as I know he never sent any money Now your own private opinion Mr Cayley Do you think that Mark was unfair to his brother Unduly hard on him They d never liked each other as boys There was never any affection between them I don t know whose fault it was in the first place if anybody s Still Mark might have given him a hand I understand said Cayley that Robert spent his whole life asking for hands The inspector nodded I know that sort Well now we ll go on,E
subject he wished to avoid To break the silence he asked carelessly if the Inspector had gone Cayley nodded Then he said abruptly He s getting a warrant for Mark s arrest Bill made a suitably sympathetic noise and Antony said with a shrug of the shoulders Well he was bound to do that wasn t he It doesn t follow that well it doesn t mean anything They naturally want to get hold of your cousin innocent or guilty Which do you think he is Mr Gillingham said Cayley looking at him steadily Mark It s absurd said Bill,E

profoundly disappointed What on earth has the ghost got to do with it I don t know said Antony apologetically I don t know what anything has got to do with it I was just wondering You shouldn t have brought me here if you hadn t wanted me to think about the ghost This is where she appeared isn t it Yes Bill was distinctly short about it How What I said How How How _do_ ghosts appear I don t know They just appear Over four or five hundred yards of open park Well but she had to,E
devil for taking offence That Miss Norris did you see her _she s_ done for herself I don t mind betting what you like that _she never_ comes here again Why Bill laughed to himself We were all in it really at least Betty and I were There s supposed to be a ghost attached to the house Lady Anne Patten Ever heard of her Never Mark told us about her at dinner one night He rather liked the idea of there being a ghost in his house you know except that he doesn t believe in ghosts I think,E
to keep up a conversation with a silent man for any length of time Bill had dropped into silence too Or rather he hummed to himself hit at thistles in the grass with his stick and made uncomfortable noises with his pipe But he noticed that his companion kept looking back over his shoulder almost as if he wanted to remember for a future occasion the way by which they were coming Yet there was no difficulty about it for they remained all the time in view of the road and the belt of trees above the long park wall,E
master you are here sir said Audrey decisively She closed the door and left him there Well Here was something to tell auntie Her mind was busy at once going over all the things which he had said to her and she had said to him quiet like Directly I saw him I said to myself Why you could have knocked her over with a feather Feathers indeed were a perpetual menace to Audrey However the immediate business was to find the master She walked across the hall to the library glanced in came back a little uncertainly and stood,E

Bill Antony pulled out the top garment and shook it out It was a wet brown flannel coat Do you recognize it he asked Mark s brown flannel suit The one he is advertised as having run away in Yes It looks like it Of course he had a dashed lot of clothes Antony put his hand in the breast pocket and took out some letters He considered them doubtfully for a moment I suppose I d better read them he said I mean just to see He looked inquiringly at Bill who nodded Antony turned on his torch and,E

just inside the hall leaning on his stick and thinking no doubt that a great deal of fuss was being made about nothing But then he had not heard the shot Window of course What an idiot I am He pushed past Antony and began running out into the drive Antony followed him They ran along the front of the house down a path to the left and then to the left again over the grass Cayley in front the other close behind him Suddenly Cayley looked over his shoulder and pulled up short Here he said They had come,E

good deal at the Red House and Mark s preference call it kindliness or vanity as you please was for guests who were not in a position to repay his hospitality Let us have a look at them as they came down to that breakfast of which Stevens the parlour maid has already given us a glimpse The first to appear was Major Rumbold a tall grey haired grey moustached silent man wearing a Norfolk coat and grey flannel trousers who lived on his retired pay and wrote natural history articles for the papers He inspected the dishes on the,E
from the door and was hurried out again by the others wishing that she had not given her presence away But it was hard to listen in silence when she knew so well from her novelettes just what happened on these occasions I shall have to give that girl a piece of my mind said Mrs Stevens Well Elsie He said I heard him say it with my own ears It s my turn now he said triumphant like Well if you think that s a threat dear you re very particular I must say But Audrey remembered Elsie s,E
for eight o clock Anyhow we ll meet at eight if not before Good He nodded to Antony and strode off back to Stanton again Antony stood watching him with a little smile at his enthusiasm Then he looked round slowly as if in search of something Suddenly he saw what he wanted Twenty yards farther on a lane wandered off to the left and there was a gate a little way up on the right hand side of it Antony walked to the gate filling his pipe as he went Then he lit his pipe sat on the gate,E
cold blooded Cayley may be capable of it but I hate to think of it But dash it all your other way is cold blooded enough According to you he goes up to the office and deliberately shoots a man with whom he has no quarrel whom he hasn t seen for fifteen years Yes but to save his own neck That makes a difference My theory is that he quarrelled violently with Mark over the girl and killed him in sudden passion Anything that happened after that would be self defense I don t mean that I excuse it,E
neither he nor his body could ever be found Well that doesn t often happen with a missing man He generally gets discovered in the end a professional criminal perhaps not but an amateur like Mark He might have kept the secret of _how_ he killed Mark but I think it would have become obvious sooner or later that he _had_ killed him Yes there s something in that Oh just tell me one thing Why did Mark tell Miss Norbury about his imaginary brother That s puzzled me rather too Bill It may be that he was just doing,E
and I told him that I was quite certain it would make no difference to my daughter s feelings for him After all the brother was in Australia When was this Yesterday Antony felt that if Mark had only mentioned it after his brother s announcement of a personal call at the Red House this perfect frankness had a good deal of wisdom behind it It couldn t have been yesterday Mr Gillingham Yesterday she shuddered and shook her head I thought perhaps he had been down here in the morning Oh no There is such a thing Mr Gillingham,E
Cayley comes again Your bedroom is the left hand end one and Cayley s the end but one Is that right Bill nodded Right Wait in hiding till I come back I don t know how long I shall be but don t be impatient It will seem longer than it is He patted Bill on the shoulder and with a smile and a nod of the head he left him there What was in the bag What could Cayley want to hide other than a key or a revolver Keys and revolvers sink of themselves no need to put,E
After dinner was over he suggested a stroll outside They walked up and down the gravel in front of the house saying very little to each other until Bill could stand it no longer For the last twenty turns he had been slowing down hopefully each time they came to the door but the hint had always been lost on his companions and each time another turn had been taken But in the end he had been firm What about a little billiards he said shaking himself free from the others Will you play said Antony to Cayley I ll,E
the two girls huddled closer and with an arm round each Mrs Stevens sat there waiting CHAPTER II Mr Gillingham Gets Out at the Wrong Station Whether Mark Ablett was a bore or not depended on the point of view but it may be said at once that he never bored his company on the subject of his early life However stories get about There is always somebody who knows It was understood and this anyhow on Mark s own authority that his father had been a country clergyman It was said that as a boy Mark had attracted the,E
friend Mr Gillingham didn t overhear him CHAPTER XIII The Open Window Anthony s first thought was that Cayley had hidden something something perhaps which he had found by the body and but that was absurd In the time at his disposal he could have done no more than put it away in a drawer where it would be much more open to discovery by Antony than if he had kept it in his pocket In any case he would have removed it by this time and hidden it in some more secret place Besides why in this case bother,E
at his feet feeling already the rope round his neck his mind darting this way and that in frantic search for a way of escape and suppose that suddenly and irrelevantly he remembers that Robert is coming to the house at three o clock that afternoon automatically he looks at his watch in half an hour s time In half an hour s time He must think of something quickly quickly Shall he bury the body in the passage and let it be thought that Mark ran away frightened at the mere thought of his brother s arrival But there,E
back unobserved to the house and reported to Antony they were going to explore the secret passage Again what fun Unfortunately there seemed to be no chance of buried treasure but there might be buried clues Even if you found nothing you couldn t get away from the fact that a secret passage was a secret passage and anything might happen in it But even that wasn t the end of this exciting day They were going to watch the pond that night they were going to watch Cayley under the moonlight watch him as he threw into the silence,E
crop of wild oats to the harvesting of others and became in his turn a patron He patronized the Arts It was not only usurers who discovered that Mark Ablett no longer wrote for money editors were now offered free contributions as well as free lunches publishers were given agreements for an occasional slender volume in which the author paid all expenses and waived all royalties promising young painters and poets dined with him and he even took a theatrical company on tour playing host and lead with equal lavishness He was not what most people call a snob A,E
and was now lying in the shrubbery which bordered the lawn waiting for the light to go up in Cayley s window If it went up in Bill s window then they were discovered It would mean that Cayley had glanced into Bill s room had been suspicious of the dummy figure in the bed and had turned up the light to make sure After that it was war between them But if it went up in Cayley s room There was a light Antony felt a sudden thrill of excitement It was in Bill s room War The light,E
watch for his return there the light in his bedroom before conducting their experiments at the pond But then they might miss his second visit in this way if he made a second visit It was difficult His eyes were fixed on the boat as he considered these things and suddenly as if materialized from nowhere Cayley was standing by the boat In his hand was a small brown bag Cayley put the bag in the bottom of the boat stepped in and using an oar as a punt pole pushed slowly off Then very silently he rowed towards the,E
them in a bag first What was in the bag Something which wouldn t sink of itself something which needed to be helped with stones before it would hide itself safely in the mud Well they would find that out There was no object in worrying about it now Bill had a dirty night s work in front of him But where was the body which Antony had expected so confidently or if there were no body where was Mark More immediately however where was Cayley As quickly as he could Antony had got to the front of the house,E
be shown in the evidence a shot was heard and when perhaps five minutes later the room was forced open the dead body of Robert Ablett was found stretched upon the floor As regards Mark Ablett nobody had seen him from the moment of his going into the room but evidence would be called to show that he had enough money on him at the time to take him to any other part of the country and that a man answering to his description had been observed on the platform of Stanton station apparently waiting to catch the 3 55,E
What are we going to do They re going to drag the pond beg its pardon the lake Where is the lake We re on the way to it now if you d like to see it We may as well look at it Do you haunt the lake much in the ordinary way Oh no rather not There s nothing to do there You can t bathe Well I shouldn t care to Too dirty I see This is the way we came yesterday isn t it The way to the village Yes We go off a bit to,E

time then while he was hammering the key in his pocket at the locked door he must suddenly have remembered with what a shock that a mistake had been made A window had not been left open Probably it would just have been a horrible doubt at first _Was_ the office window open Surely it was open _Was_ it Would he have time now to unlock the door slip in open the French windows and slip out again No At any moment the servants might come It was too risky Fatal if he were discovered But servants were stupid He,E
has put there for him to find But if he doesn t then it will be because Cayley is going to hide something there to night What asked Bill again You will see what Bill said Antony because we shall be there Are we going to watch him Yes if the Inspector finds nothing That s good said Bill If it were a question of Cayley or the Law he was quite decided as to which side he was taking Previous to the tragedy of yesterday he had got on well enough with both of the cousins without being in,E
being what he wished most to be an artist No Othello ever blacked himself all over with such enthusiasm as did Mark His beard was going anyhow possible a chance remark of Miss Norbury s helped here She did not like beards But it was important for me that the dead man s hands should not be the hands of a manicured gentleman Five minutes playing upon the vanity of the artist settled his hands He let the nails grow and then cut them raggedly Miss Norris would notice your hands at once I had said Besides as an artist,E
temper Robert is the tough customer Mark the highly civilized gentleman If there has been a quarrel it is Robert who has shot Mark He bangs at the door again Of course to Antony coming suddenly upon this scene Cayley s conduct had seemed rather absurd but then just for the moment Cayley had lost his head Anybody else might have done the same But as soon as Antony suggested trying the windows Cayley saw that that was the obvious thing to do So he leads the way to the windows the longest way Why To give the murderer time,E
it Cayley shrugged his shoulders and went to the telephone May I er look round a bit Antony nodded towards the open door Oh do Yes He sat down and drew the telephone towards him You must make allowances for me Mr Gillingham You see I ve known Mark for a very long time But of course you re quite right and I m merely being stupid He took off the receiver Let us suppose that for the purpose of making a first acquaintance with this office we are coming into it from the hall through the door which is,E
but that I understand it And I think that Mark s dead body is in the passage now and has been there since say half past two yesterday afternoon And to night Cayley is going to hide it in the pond Bill pulled at the moss on the ground beside him threw away a handful or two and said slowly You may be right but it s all guess work you know Antony laughed Good Lord of course it is he said And to night we shall know if it s a good guess or a bad one Bill brightened,E
a moment asking himself a question It was rather a curious question He was asking himself why the door was open Well not exactly why the door was open that could be explained easily enough But why had he expected the door to be shut He did not remember shutting it but somehow he was surprised to see it open now to see Cayley through the doorway just coming into the room Something working sub consciously in his brain had told him that it was surprising Why He tucked the matter away in a corner of his mind for the,E
seen him since and now here was this letter She dreaded opening it It was a relief to feel that at least she had an excuse for not doing so while her guests were in the house Mrs Norbury recognized at once that Antony was likely to be the more sympathetic listener and when tea was over and Bill and Angela had been dispatched to the garden with the promptness and efficiency of the expert dear Mr Gillingham found himself on the sofa beside her listening to many things which were of even greater interest to him than she could,E
Bill s hand in both of his There is nothing that you and I could not accomplish together if we gave our minds to it Silly old ass That s what you always say when I m being serious Well anyway thanks awfully You really saved us this time Were you coming back Yes At least I think I was I was just wondering when I heard you tapping The fact of the door being shut was rather surprising Of course the whole idea was to see if it could be opened easily from the other side but I felt,E
he got the handkerchief from the chest of drawers Wait a bit He got up and went into the adjoining room looked round it pulled open a drawer or two and after shutting all the doors came back to the office The sponge is there and there are handkerchiefs in the top right hand drawer Now then Bill just pretend you re Cayley You ve just said something about water and you get up Feeling that it was all a little uncanny Bill who had been kneeling beside his friend got up and walked out Antony as he had done,E

a tragedy had happened before he knew that anybody was missing Those first impressions which are so vitally important had been received solely on the merits of the case they were founded on the evidence of his senses not on the evidence of his emotions or of other people s senses He was in a much better position for getting at the truth than was the Inspector It is possible that in thinking this Antony was doing Inspector Birch a slight injustice Birch was certainly prepared to believe that Mark had shot his brother Robert had been shown into the,E
him to explain What for instance had Antony been looking for in the cupboard I think began Antony slowly that after last night we must give up the idea that Mark has been killed killed I mean by Cayley I don t believe anybody would go to so much trouble to hide a suit of clothes when he had a body on his hands The body would seem so much more important I think we may take it now that the clothes are all that Cayley had to hide But why not have kept them in the passage He was,E
to the seat and sat down What a heavenly night said Antony Ripping I wonder where that poor devil Mark is now It s a rum business You agree with Cayley that it was an accident Yes You see I know Mark H m Antony produced a pencil and a piece of paper and began to write on his knee but while he wrote he talked He said that he thought Mark had shot his brother in a fit of anger and that Cayley knew or anyhow guessed this and had tried to give his cousin a chance of getting,E
close the door like that As an afterthought you know and very quietly so that I don t hear the click of it Bill did as he was told and then put his head out eagerly to hear what had happened That was it said Antony with absolute conviction That was just what I saw yesterday He came out of the office and joined Bill in the little room And now he said let s try and find out what it was that Mr Cayley was doing in here and why he had to be so very careful that his,E
had come into money had been a cause of great bitterness between them It was shortly after this that Robert had left for Australia He had made inquiries at Stanton station It had been market day at Stanton and the station had been more full of arrivals than usual Nobody had particularly noticed the arrival of Robert Ablett there had been a good many passengers by the 2 10 train that afternoon the train by which Robert had undoubtedly come from London A witness however would state that he noticed a man resembling Mark Ablett at the station at 3,E
more dignified establishment For there was no doubt that eligibility meant not only eligibility as a husband But it was not as eligibles that the visitors from the Red House were received with such eagerness to day and even if her special smile for possibles was there it was instinctive rather than reasoned All that she wanted at this moment was news news of Mark For she was bringing it off at last and if the engagement columns of the Morning Post were preceded as in the case of its obituary columns by a premonitory bulletin the announcement of yesterday,E
on the previous day looked up after him as he went Bill turned into the room on the right opened the drawer and got the handkerchief damped the sponge and came back Well he said wonderingly Antony shook his head It s all different he said For one thing you made a devil of a noise and Cayley didn t Perhaps you weren t listening when Cayley went in I wasn t But I should have heard him if I could have heard him and I should have remembered afterwards Perhaps Cayley shut the door after him Wait He pressed,E
the Othello business painting himself black all over I mean he may have been so full of his appearance as Robert that he had almost got to believe in Robert and had to tell everybody More likely though he felt that having told all of you at the house he had better tell Miss Norbury in case she met one of you in which case if you mentioned the approaching arrival of Robert she might say Oh I m certain he has no brother he would have told me if he had and so spoil his joke Possibly too Cayley,E

thoroughly upset about the key business He suddenly realized that he had been careless and he hadn t got time to think it all over So he didn t want to commit himself definitely to the statement that the key was either outside or inside He wanted to leave it vague It was safest that way I see said Bill slowly But his mind was elsewhere He was wondering suddenly about Cayley Cayley was just an ordinary man like himself Bill had had little jokes with him sometimes not that Cayley was much of a hand at joking Bill had,E

boy grew up Mark s designs for his future were based on his own interests as much as those of his cousin and that a suitably educated Matthew Cayley of twenty three was felt by him to be a useful property for a man in his position a man that is to say whose vanities left him so little time for his affairs Cayley then at twenty three looked after his cousin s affairs By this time Mark had bought the Red House and the considerable amount of land which went with it Cayley superintended the necessary staff His duties,E
The George gave me a good character The Inspector looked at him quickly Now how on earth do you know anything about that Antony bowed to him gravely Because I guessed that you were a very efficient member of the Force The inspector laughed Well you came out all right Mr Gillingham You got a clean bill But I had to make certain about you Of course you did Well I wish you luck But I don t think you ll find much at the pond It s rather out of the way isn t it for anybody running away,E
finding something to suit him And which is _your_ particular fancy Bill said Antony looking from one shelf to another Or are you always playing billiards I have a look at Badminton sometimes said Bill It s over in that corner there He waved a hand Over here said Antony going to it Yes He corrected himself suddenly Oh no it s not It s over there on the right now Mark had a grand re arrangement of his library about a year ago It took him more than a week he told us He s got such a frightful,E
book Excitement was written all over it Well he said eagerly as he sat down to the business of the meal what are we going to do this morning Not talk so loudly for one thing said Antony Bill looked about him apprehensively Was Cayley under the table for example After last night one never knew Is er He raised his eyebrows No But one doesn t want to shout One should modulate the voice my dear William while breathing gently from the hips Thus one avoids those chest notes which have betrayed many a secret In other words pass,E
He wasn t keen but Mark made him Miss Norris wasn t playing I see My dear Tony she s a professional Of course she wasn t Antony laughed again A great success was it Oh rather I m a fool and a damned fool Antony announced solemnly And a damned fool he said again under his breath as he led Bill away from the poster and out of the yard into the road And a damned fool Even now He broke off and then asked suddenly Did Mark ever have much trouble with his teeth He went to his,E

a dentist for that Who could do it better Could _you_ have done it How could you You d never gone bathing with Mark you d never seen him stripped He didn t swim Could his doctor do it Not unless he d had some particular operation and perhaps not then But his dentist could at any time always if he had been to his dentist fairly often Hence Mr Cartwright of Wimpole Street Bill nodded thoughtfully and went back again to the letter I see And you told Cayley that you were telegraphing to Cartwright to identify the body,E
down his ruffled feathers She had behaved very badly but he was quite right he must try not to show how much he disapproved of her And of course she would never come again that was obvious And then suddenly I began to laugh He looked up at me indignantly Is there a joke he said coldly I laughed gently again I was just thinking I said that it would be rather amusing if you well had your revenge My revenge How do you mean Well paid her back in her own coin Do you mean try and frighten her,E
So he had to be killed I was the only one left to protect her for her mother was in league with Mark to bring about her ruin I would have shot him openly for her sake and with what gladness but I had no mind to sacrifice myself needlessly He was in my power I could persuade him to almost anything by flattery surely it would not be difficult to give his death the appearance of an accident I need not take up your time by telling you of the many plans I made and rejected For some days,E
if he stayed in the house that night Very well then That s one thing we ve discovered Mark knew that Robert was staying in the house that night Or shall we put it this way he knew that there was no chance of getting Robert out of the house at once Bill looked at his friend eagerly Go on he said This is getting interesting He also knew something else went on Antony He knew that Robert was bound to betray his real character to you as soon as you met him He couldn t pass him off on,E
he wanted all of us to believe in her and yet he was annoyed with Betty and Mrs Calladine for believing in ghosts at all Rum chap Well anyhow Miss Norris she s an actress some actress too dressed up as the ghost and played the fool a bit And poor Mark was frightened out of his life Just for a moment you know What about the others Well Betty and I knew in fact I d told her Miss Norris I mean not to be a silly ass Knowing Mark Mrs Calladine wasn t there Betty wouldn t let,E

er do well who had spent most of his life in Australia and that he had announced in what might almost be called a threatening letter his intention of visiting his brother that afternoon There would be evidence of his arrival of his being shown into the scene of the tragedy a room in the Red House commonly called the office and of his brother s entrance into that room The jury would have to form their own opinion as to what happened there But whatever happened happened almost instantaneously Within two minutes of Mark Ablett s entrance as would,E
say something more and then as nothing was coming he turned round said Come on Tony and led the way upstairs Got all you want he said at the top of the stairs I think so Come and see me before you go down Righto Antony shut his bedroom door behind him and walked over to the window He pushed open a casement and looked out His bedroom was just over the door at the back of the house The side wall of the office which projected out into the lawn beyond the rest of the house was on his,E
he had hesitated to define his position that morning in regard to Mark he did not hesitate to place himself on the side of the Law against Cayley Mark after all had done him no harm but Cayley had committed an unforgivable offence Cayley had listened secretly to a private conversation between himself and Tony Let Cayley hang if the Law demanded it Antony looked at his watch and stood up Come along he said It s time for that job I spoke about The passage said Bill eagerly No the thing which I said that I had to do,E
in your bed that looked vaguely like you in the dark A bolster with a pyjama coat round it and one arm outside the blanket and a pair of socks or something for the head You know the kind of thing I think it would please him to feel that you were still sleeping peacefully Bill chuckled to himself Rather I m awfully good at that I ll make him up something really good But what about you I m at the other end of the house he s hardly likely to bother about me a second time And I,E
like said Antony Cold Well here s luck to it He gave a sudden kick flashed for a moment in the water and was gone Antony steadied the boat and took another look at his landmarks Bill came up behind him with a loud explosion It s pretty muddy he protested Weeds No thank the Lord Well try again Bill gave another kick and disappeared Again Antony coaxed the boat back into position and again Bill popped up this time in front of him I feel that if I threw you a sardine said Antony with a smile you d,E
would be something Of course Antony smiled back at him and said cheerfully Well then I ll begin by suggesting that you should ring up the police The police Y yes He looked doubtfully at the other I suppose Antony spoke frankly Now look here Mr er Cayley I m Mark Ablett s cousin I live with him My name s Gillingham I m sorry I ought to have told you before Well now Mr Cayley we shan t do any good by pretending Here s a man been shot well somebody shot him He might have shot himself mumbled,E
We all do Oh He looked at Antony with interest D you know where you are in this case I know where I m going to be Where s that Put through it by Inspector Birch said Antony with a smile The inspector laughed genially Well I ll spare you as much as I can Come along They went into the library The inspector seated himself at a writing table and Cayley sat in a chair by the side of it Antony made himself comfortable in an armchair and prepared to be interested We ll start with the dead man,E
up suddenly To night he said I say to night s going to be rather fun How do we work it Antony was silent for a little Of course he said at last we ought to inform the police so that they can come here and watch the pond to night Of course grinned Bill But I think that perhaps it is a little early to put our theories before them I think perhaps it is said Bill solemnly Antony looked up at him with a sudden smile Bill you old bounder Well dash it it s our show I,E
decision at breakfast to tell you all about his brother It wasn t instantaneous He knew on Monday that Robert was coming and decided then that you would all have to know Then how do you explain the letter Well let s have a look at it Antony took the letter from his pocket and spread it out on the grass between them _ Mark your loving brother is coming to see you to morrow all the way from Australia I give you warning so that you will be able to conceal your surprise but not I hope your pleasure,E

brain of his had already told him that he was the only person in the house at that moment who was unhandicapped in the search for truth The inspector had arrived in it to find a man dead and a man missing It was extremely probable no doubt that the missing man had shot the dead man But it was more than extremely probable it was almost certain that the Inspector would start with the idea that this extremely probable solution was the one true solution and that in consequence he would be less disposed to consider without prejudice any,E
own ends it was impossible that it could be treated as the evidence of an impartial and trustworthy onlooker Such for instance as Elsie appeared to be Elsie s evidence however seemed to settle the point Mark had gone into the office to see his brother Elsie had heard them both talking and then Antony and Cayley had found the body of Robert and the Inspector was going to drag the pond But certainly Elsie s evidence did not prove anything more than the mere presence of Mark in the room It s my turn now you wait That was,E
his hand over his eyes and thought It wasn t anything which he had heard but something which he had seen He tried desperately hard to see it again He saw Cayley getting up opening the door from the office leaving it open and walking into the passage turning to the door on the right opening it going in and then What did his eyes see after that If they would only tell him again Suddenly he jumped up his face alight Bill I ve got it he cried What The shadow on the wall I was looking at the,E

s room had heard something of the news by this time and Audrey had had a busy time explaining to other members of the staff exactly what _he_ had said and what _she_ had said The details were not quite established yet but this much at least was certain that Mr Mark s brother had shot himself and spirited Mr Mark away and that Audrey had seen at once that he was that sort of man when she opened the door to him She had passed the remark to Mrs Stevens And Mrs Stevens if you remember Audrey had always,E
For a moment he stood listening with his head on one side holding up a finger to bid Bill listen too What is it whispered Bill Antony waved him to silence and remained listening Very quietly he went down on his knees and listened again Then he put his ear to the floor He got up and dusted himself quickly walked across to Bill and whispered in his ear Footsteps Somebody coming When I begin to talk back me up Bill nodded Antony gave him an encouraging pat on the back and stepped firmly across to the box of bowls,E
you Elsie gave him a smile and returned eagerly to the kitchen She was ready for Mrs Stevens or anybody now Meanwhile Antony had been exploring a little on his own There was a point which was puzzling him He went through the hall to the front of the house and stood at the open door looking out on to the drive He and Cayley had run round the house to the left Surely it would have been quicker to have run round to the right The front door was not in the middle of the house it was to,E
down and up the shelf Sport and Travel chiefly I like books of travel don t you They re pretty dull as a rule Well anyhow some people like them very much said Antony reproachfully He moved on to the next row of shelves The Drama The Restoration dramatists You can have most of them Still as you well remark many people seem to love them Shaw Wilde Robertson I like reading plays Bill There are not many people who do but those who do are usually very keen Let us pass on I say we haven t too much,E
listen to what they were saying He might do this merely by opening the door a little without showing himself in which case Antony would have found the entrance to the passage without any trouble to himself But when Bill turned his head and talked over the back of the seat it was probable that the listener would find it necessary to put his head outside in order to hear and then Antony would be able to discover who it was Moreover if he should venture out of his hiding place altogether and peep at them over the top of,E
it there The obvious answer was that he hadn t Mark had put it there I remembered what you told me about Mark being finicky and having lots of clothes and so on and I felt that he was just the sort of man who would never wear the same collar twice He paused and then asked Is that right do you think Absolutely said Bill with conviction Well I guessed it was So then I began to see an x which would fit just this part of the problem the clothes part I saw Mark changing his clothes I,E
the town for which Antony had taken a ticket that morning only six hours ago How absurd it seemed About twenty miles These people will be coming back soon Beverley and the others Yes I expect they ll want to go away at once Much better that they should Yes Cayley was silent for a little Then he said You re staying near here I m at The George at Woodham If you re by yourself I wish you d put up here You see he went on awkwardly you ll have to _be_ here for the the inquest and,E
Aren t I going at all said Bill in great disappointment When Antony spoke it was to ask another question Can Cayley drive a car Yes of course Why Then he might easily drop the chauffeur at his lodge and go off to Stanton or wherever he wanted to on his own I suppose so if he wanted to Yes Antony got up Well look here as we said we were going into the village and as we promised to leave that letter I almost think we d better do it Oh Oh very well Jallands What were you telling,E
when he stays in Australia fifteen years as Mr Mark says and as I know for myself for five years he has his reasons And a respectably brought up girl doesn t ask what reasons Got into trouble I suppose said Audrey carelessly They were saying at breakfast he d been a wild one Debts I m glad Joe isn t like that He s got fifteen pounds in the post office savings bank Did I tell you But there was not to be any more talk of Joe Turner that afternoon The ringing of a bell brought Audrey to,E
Neither time nor opportunity Which is rather a consoling thought to a lazy person like me But it makes it much harder if we can t really look properly Harder to find yes but so much easier to look For instance the passage might begin in Cayley s bedroom Well now we know that it doesn t We don t know anything of the sort protested Bill We know for the purposes of our search Obviously we can t go tailing into Cayley s bedroom and tapping his wardrobes and obviously therefore if we are going to look for it,E

about this visit of Robert s at all I didn t see very much of him in the morning I was at work in my room and outside and so on We lunched together and he talked of it then a little In what terms Well he hesitated and then went on I can t think of a better word than peevishly Occasionally he said What do you think he wants or Why couldn t he have stayed where he was or I don t like the tone of his letter Do you think he means trouble He talked rather,E
somehow that you wouldn t shut it until the last possible moment until you saw me coming back Well then I heard the taps and I knew it must mean something so I sat tight Then when C began to come along I said Cayley b Jove bright aren t I and I simply hared to the other end of the passage for all I was worth And hared back again Because I thought you might be getting rather involved in explanations about where I was and so on You didn t see Mark then No Nor his No I,E
looked again but it was all out of focus I will _not_ look again he said aloud as he began to walk towards the house Not yet anyway He would go on collecting facts and impressions Perhaps the one fact would come along by itself which would make everything clear CHAPTER XIV Mr Beverley Qualifies for the Stage Bill had come back and had reported rather breathless that Cayley was still at the pond But I don t think they re getting up much except mud he said I ran most of the way back so as to give us,E

another one in the passage to escape in and then have had the brown one on his hands And thought it safest to hide it in the pond Yes said Anthony thoughtfully Then Go on Bill went on eagerly It all seems to fit in you know I mean even with your first theory that Mark killed him accidentally and then came to Cayley for help Of course if Cayley had played fair he d have told Mark that he had nothing to be afraid of But he isn t playing fair he wants to get Mark out of the,E
Antony with a smile I daresay the underclothes could be explained But here s the difficulty Why did Mark need to change from brown to blue or whatever it was when Cayley was the only person who saw him in brown The police description of him says that he is in a brown suit Yes because Cayley told the police You see even if Mark had had lunch in his brown suit and the servants had noticed it Cayley could always have pretended that he had changed into blue after lunch because only Cayley saw him afterwards So if Cayley,E
seat Damn it said Antony to himself why do I like the fellow Antony Gillingham Again the eager interest of the room could be felt Who was this stranger who had got mixed up in the business so mysteriously Antony smiled at Bill and stepped up to give his evidence He explained how he came to be staying at The George at Woodham how he had heard that the Red House was in the neighbourhood how he had walked over to see his friend Beverley and had arrived just after the tragedy Thinking it over afterwards he was fairly certain,E
are now Or do you stay indoors and play billiards all the time Oh Lord no Well tennis and things So many people with beautiful parks never by any chance use them and all the poor devils passing by on the dusty road think how lucky the owners are to have them and imagine them doing all sorts of jolly things inside He pointed to the right Ever been over there Bill laughed as if a little ashamed Well not very much I ve often been along here of course because it s the short way to the village Yes,E
it was on that big ugly face Such a gentleman Mr Cayley she thought to herself as she went on and wondered what the master would do without him If this brother for instance had to be bundled back to Australia it was Mr Cayley who would do most of the bundling So this is Mr Robert said Audrey to herself as she came in sight of the visitor She told her aunt afterwards that she would have known him anywhere for Mr Mark s brother but she would have said that in any event Actually she was surprised Dapper,E
to be kept secret When did he change The only possible time was between lunch when he would be seen by the servants and the moment of Robert s arrival And when did Cayley collect the clothes in a bundle Again the only answer was Before Robert s arrival So another x was wanted to fit those three conditions And the answer was that a murder was intended even before Robert arrived Yes Well now it couldn t be intended on the strength of that letter unless there was very much more behind the letter than we knew Nor was,E
appear here because this is where the original one Lady Anne you know was supposed to walk Oh never mind Lady Anne A real ghost can do anything But how did Miss Norris appear suddenly over five hundred yards of bare park Bill looked at Antony with open mouth I I don t know he stammered We never thought of that You would have seen her long before wouldn t you if she had come the way we came Of course we should And that would have spoilt it rather You would have had time to recognize her walk Bill,E
all he was going to stalk Cayley There was a little copse above the level of the pond and about a hundred yards away from it He would come into this from the back creep cautiously through it taking care that no twigs cracked and then drawing himself on his stomach to the edge peer down upon the scene below him People were always doing that sort of thing in books and he had been filled with a hopeless envy of them well now he was actually going to do it himself What fun And then when he had got,E
simply because there was more credit attached to it A sensational arrest of somebody in the house would have given him more pleasure than a commonplace pursuit of Mark Ablett across country Mark must be found guilty or not guilty But there were other possibilities It would have interested Antony to know that just at the time when he was feeling rather superior to the prejudiced inspector the Inspector himself was letting his mind dwell lovingly upon the possibilities in connection with Mr Gillingham Was it only a coincidence that Mr Gillingham had turned up just when he did And,E

Miss Norris then because it was necessary for my plan that Mark should be thoroughly frightened Without the passage she could never have got close enough to the bowling green to alarm him properly but as I arranged it with her she made the most effective appearance and Mark was in just the state of rage and vindictiveness which I required Miss Norris you understand is a professional actress I need not say that to her I appeared to be animated by no other feeling than a boyish desire to bring off a good joke a joke directed as much,E
while the elder was poor and an exile was not known nor as far as the inspector could see was it likely to be known until Mark was captured The discovery of Mark was all that mattered immediately Dragging the pond might not help towards this but it would certainly give the impression in court to morrow that Inspector Birch was handling the case with zeal And if only the revolver with which the deed was done was brought to the surface his trouble would be well repaid Inspector Birch produces the weapon would make an excellent headline in the,E
opposite side nearer to the house She couldn t have been hiding in the ditch Do you call it the moat by the way Mark does We don t among ourselves No she couldn t Betty and I were here before the others and walked round a bit We should have seen her Then she must have been hiding in the shed Or do you call it the summer house We had to go there for the bowls of course She couldn t have been there Oh It s dashed funny said Bill after an interval for thought But it,E

letters did he know And what letter would convey anything to Antony He pulled at his pipe his eyes wandering from Cayley at his desk to the Reverend Theodore Ussher in his shelf What letter C for Cayley Would Antony understand Probably not but it was just worth trying What was C Long short long short Umpty iddy umpty iddy Was that right C yes that was C He was sure of that C Umpty iddy umpty iddy Hands in pockets he got up and wandered across the room humming vaguely to himself the picture of a man waiting for,E
stay as he wished could have been left safely to them As it was they had been given no alternative and Miss Norris who had proposed to catch an after dinner train at the junction in the obvious hope that she might have in this way a dramatic cross examination at the hands of some keen eyed detective was encouraged tactfully but quite firmly to travel by the earlier train with the others Antony had felt that Cayley in the tragedy which had suddenly befallen the house ought to have been equally indifferent to her presence or absence But he,E
on guard while he himself follows a train of thought in another direction Many people do this of course when for instance they are talking to one person and trying to listen to another but their eyes betray them Antony s never did He had seen a good deal of the world with those eyes though never as a sailor When at the age of twenty one he came into his mother s money 400 a year old Gillingham looked up from the Stockbreeders Gazette to ask what he was going to do See the world said Antony Well send,E
guilty of murder it would not prejudice his trial in any way if and when he was apprehended The jury could consider their verdict They considered it They announced that the deceased had died as the result of a bullet wound and that the bullet had been fired by his brother Mark Ablett Bill turned round to Antony at his side But Antony was gone Across the room he saw Andrew Amos and Parsons going out of the door together and Antony was between them CHAPTER XX Mr Beverley is Tactful The inquest had been held at the Lamb at,E

you know how to look at them So Antony looked at them from various strange corners from the view point of the valet the newspaper reporter the waiter the shop assistant With the independence of 400 a year behind him he enjoyed it immensely He never stayed long in one job and generally closed his connection with it by telling his employer contrary to all etiquette as understood between master and servant exactly what he thought of him He had no difficulty in finding a new profession Instead of experience and testimonials he offered his personality and a sporting bet,E

through which he had gone remained open The door at the end of the short passage was shut Antony kneeling by the body followed Cayley with his eyes and after he had disappeared kept his eyes on the blank wall of the passage but he was not conscious of that at which he was looking for his mind was with the other man sympathizing with him Not that water is any use to a dead body he said to himself but the feeling that you re doing something when there s obviously nothing to be done is a great comfort,E
heard him at least she says she did But if he was there he came out again by the door Well but where does that lead you Where it led Mark The passage Do you mean that he s been hiding there all the time Antony was silent until Bill had repeated his question and then with an effort he came out of his thoughts and answered him I don t know But look here Here is a possible explanation I don t know if it is the right one I don t know Bill I m rather frightened Frightened,E
told Mrs Norbury about him on Monday What do you make of that Coincidence said Bill after careful thought He d always meant to tell her his suit was prospering and just before it was finally settled he told her That happened to be Monday On Tuesday he got Robert s letter and felt jolly glad that he d told her in time Well it might be that but it s rather a curious coincidence And here is something which makes it very curious indeed It only occurred to me in the bath this morning Inspiring place a bathroom Well,E
Tuesday afternoon He couldn t have because he died unlamented three years ago But there was nobody who knew this save Mark and myself for Mark was the only one of the family left his sister having died last year Though I doubt anyhow if she knew whether Robert was alive or dead He was not talked about For the next two days Mark and I worked out our plans You understand by now that our aims were not identical Mark s endeavour was that his deception should last for say a couple of hours mine that it should go,E
front of the house waiting for them Bill waved and he waved back Then as the car drew up Bill who was in front with the chauffeur jumped down and greeted him eagerly Hallo you madman have you come to stay or what He had a sudden idea _Don t_ say you re Mark Ablett s long lost brother from Australia though I could quite believe it of you He laughed boyishly Hallo Bill said Antony quietly Will you introduce me I m afraid I ve got some bad news Bill rather sobered by this introduced him The Major and,E
with a slightly bewildered air He did not know that Cayley was smoking a cigarette outside the windows behind him not listening perhaps possibly not even overhearing but within sight of Antony who was not going to take any risks So he went on with his breakfast reflecting that Antony was a rum fellow and wondering if he had dreamed only of the amazing things which had happened the day before Antony went up to his bedroom to fetch his pipe It was occupied by a housemaid and he made a polite apology for disturbing her Then he remembered Is,E
looked back unwaveringly and said nothing I think said the Major gently leaning over to Mrs Calladine that it would be better if you took Betty back to London to night Very well she agreed quietly You will come with us Ruth I ll see you safely there said Bill in a meek voice He didn t quite know what was happening and having expected to stay at the Red House for another week he had nowhere to go to in London but London seemed to be the place that everyone was going to and when he could get Tony,E

restful of all country sounds And in the hall a man was banging at a locked door and shouting Open the _door_ I say open the _door _ Hallo said Antony in amazement CHAPTER III Two Men and a Body Cayley looked round suddenly at the voice Can I help said Antony politely Something s happened said Cayley He was breathing quickly I heard a shot it sounded like a shot I was in the library A loud bang I didn t know what it was And the door s locked He rattled the handle again and shook it Open,E
Come on the sooner we get out now the better He led the way out of the window the silent Bill following him They reached the ground safely and noiselessly went quickly across the lawn and so over the fence into the park It was not until they were out of sight of the house that Bill felt it safe to speak I quite thought it was you in bed he said I hoped you would I shall be rather disappointed now if Cayley doesn t call again It s a pity to waste it He came all right just,E
Stanton at Stanton Robert Ablett was to be buried next day Bill waited about outside for his friend wondering where he had gone Then realizing that Cayley would be coming out to his car directly and that a farewell talk with Cayley would be a little embarrassing he wandered round to the yard at the back of the inn lit a cigarette and stood surveying a torn and weather beaten poster on the stable wall GRAND THEATRICAL ENTER it announced to take place on Wednesday Decem Bill smiled to himself as he looked at it for the part of Joe,E
said the Inspector Robert Ablett didn t you say He took out his notebook Yes Brother of Mark Ablett who lives here Ah He began to sharpen a pencil Staying in the house Oh no Antony listened attentively while Cayley explained all that he knew about Robert This was news to him I see Sent out of the country in disgrace What had he done I hardly know I was only about twelve at the time The sort of age when you re told not to ask questions Inconvenient questions Exactly So you don t really know whether he had,E
s happened to you suddenly Antony looked up at him in surprise Didn t you hear what he said What particularly That it was Cayley s idea to drag the pond Oh Oh I say Bill was rather excited again You mean that he s hidden something there Some false clue which he wants the police to find I hope so said Antony earnestly but I m afraid He stopped short Afraid of what Afraid that he hasn t hidden anything there Afraid that Well What s the safest place in which to hide anything very important Somewhere where nobody,E
is such a beastly thing anyhow I could not stop him but I kept him within certain bounds so that nobody but myself knew his secret Yes I kept him outwardly decent and perhaps now I was becoming like the cannibal who keeps his victim in good condition for his own ends I used to gloat over Mark thinking how utterly he was mine to ruin as I pleased financially morally whatever way would give me most satisfaction I had but to take my hand away from him and he sank But again I was in no hurry Then he,E
It wasn t that he wanted his friends Beverley and Gillingham to be asleep before he started on his business at the pond all that he wanted was to be sure that they were safely in their bedrooms Cayley s business would make no noise give no sign to attract the most wakeful member of the household so long as the household was really inside the house But if he wished to reassure himself about his guests he would have to wait until they were far enough on their way to sleep not to be disturbed by him as he,E
came up to reassure himself So it amounted to the same thing really He would wait until they were asleep until they were asleep asleep With a great effort Bill regained the mastery over his wandering thoughts and came awake again This would never do It would be fatal if he went to sleep if he went to sleep to sleep And then in an instant he was intensely awake Suppose Cayley never came at all Suppose Cayley was so unsuspicious that as soon as they had gone upstairs he had dived down into the passage and set about his,E
deceptive air of smoothness which retreated always as they advanced Rum isn t it said Bill An absurd place for a bowling green but I suppose it was always here Yes but always where It s short enough for golf perhaps but Hallo They had come to the place The road bent round to the right but they kept straight on over a broad grass path for twenty yards and there in front of them was the green A dry ditch ten feet wide and six feet deep surrounded it except in the one place where the path went forward,E
am not suggesting that there was anything sinister about the passage in the first place It was just a little private bit of romance and adventure for Mark three days ago He didn t even know that Robert was coming But somehow the passage has been used since in connection with Robert Perhaps Mark escaped that way perhaps he s hiding there now And if so then the only person who could give him away was Miss Norris And she of course would only do it innocently not knowing that the passage had anything to do with it So it,E
then it was time to offer him another drink and I didn t seem to be getting much nearer But I got him at last I asked him if he knew John Borden he was the man who said he d seen Mark at the station Well he knew all about Borden and after he d told me all about Borden s wife s family and how one of them had been burnt to death after you with the beer thanks well then I said carelessly that it must be very hard to remember anybody whom you had just seen,E
off to their golf only twenty four hours ago How could he help feeling that this was not real tragedy but merely a jolly kind of detective game that he and Antony were playing He turned back to his friend All the same he said you wanted to find the passage and now you ve found it Aren t you going into it at all Antony took his arm Let s go outside again he said We can t go into it now anyhow It s too risky with Cayley about Bill I feel like you just a little bit,E
can say that for dear Angela with perfect confidence Whether _he_ made advances She broke off with a shrug of her plump shoulders Antony waited eagerly Naturally they met Possibly he might have I don t know But my duty as a mother was clear Mr Gillingham Mr Gillingham made an encouraging noise I told him quite frankly that how shall I put it that he was trespassing Tactfully of _course_ But frankly You mean said Antony trying to speak calmly that you told him that er Mr Ablett and your daughter Mrs Norbury nodded several times Exactly Mr Gillingham,E
who would go about shooting his only brother I m sure you wouldn t Mrs Norbury If there has been any shooting done it has been done by somebody else Antony looked at her inquiringly I never liked him said Mrs Norbury firmly Never However thought Antony to himself that didn t quite prove that Cayley was a murderer How did Miss Norbury get on with him he asked cautiously There was _nothing_ in that at all said Miss Norbury s mother emphatically _Nothing_ I would say so to anybody Oh I beg your pardon I never meant Nothing I,E
alone for a moment Tony no doubt would explain Cayley wants you to stay Bill You have to go anyhow to morrow Major Rumbold Yes I ll come with you Mrs Calladine Mr Cayley would wish me to say again that you will please not hesitate to give your own orders both as regard the car and as regard any telephoning or telegraphing that you want done He smiled again and added Please forgive me if I seem to have taken a good deal upon myself but I just happened to be handy as a mouthpiece for Cayley He bowed,E
it all out Antony nodded At least I m very nearly there Bill There s just this one thing I want now It means your going back to Stanton Well we haven t come far it won t take you long Do you mind My dear Holmes I am at your service Antony gave him a smile and was silent for a little thinking Is there another inn at Stanton fairly close to the station The Plough and Horses just at the corner where the road goes up to the station is that the one you mean That would be,E
of a murderer would be as bad as to offer her the hand of a drunkard And Mark died for that I saw her this morning She was very sweet It is a difficult world to understand Well well we are all gone now the Abletts and the Cayleys I wonder what old Grandfather Cayley thinks of it all Perhaps it is as well that we have died out Not that there was anything wrong with Sarah except her temper And she had the Ablett nose you can t do much with that I m glad she left no children,E
fools who were pressing their noses against the panes and asking for it My God can you see it said Cayley in a shaking voice Down there Look The next moment Antony saw it A man was lying on the floor at the far end of the room his back towards them A man Or the body of a man Who is it said Antony I don t know the other whispered Well we d better go and see He considered the windows for a moment I should think if you put your weight into it just where they join,E
to do after all He returned his brushes to his bag glanced round to see that nothing else had been taken out and went down again to settle his bill He had decided to keep on his room for a few days partly to save the landlord and his wife the disappointment of losing a guest so suddenly partly in case he found it undesirable later on to remain at the Red House For he was taking himself seriously as a detective indeed he took himself seriously while getting all the fun out of it which was possible at every,E
again Bill was distinctly interested That s rather hot he said Expound Well I can t explain it whether it s something in the actual eye or something in the brain or what but I have got rather an uncanny habit of recording things unconsciously You know that game where you look at a tray full of small objects for three minutes and then turn away and try to make a list of them It means a devil of a lot of concentration for the ordinary person if he wants to get his list complete but in some odd way,E
time said Bill restlessly We haven t That s why we aren t wasting any Poetry Who reads poetry nowadays Bill when did you last read Paradise Lost Never I thought not And when did Miss Calladine last read The Excursion aloud to you As a matter of fact Betty Miss Calladine happens to be jolly keen on what s the beggar s name Never mind his name You have said quite enough We pass on He moved on to the next shelf Biography Oh lots of it I love biographies Are you a member of the Johnson Club I,E
and so on If I may offer you my cousin s hospitality in his I mean if he doesn t if he really has Antony broke in hastily with his thanks and acceptance That s good Perhaps Beverley will stay on if he s a friend of yours He s a good fellow Antony felt quite sure from what Cayley had said and had hesitated to say that Mark had been the last to see his brother alive It didn t follow that Mark Ablett was a murderer Revolvers go off accidentally and when they have gone off people lose,E
comfort and the three of them fell into a casual conversation about houses in general and The Red House in particular You were quite right about the keys said Bill during a pause He was less able than the other two perhaps because he was younger than they to keep away from the subject which was uppermost in the minds of them all Keys said Cayley blankly We were wondering whether they were outside or inside Oh oh yes He looked slowly round the hall at the different doors and then smiled in a friendly way at Antony We both,E
staying there and a good deal to be lost for Bill showed signs of running down As quickly as he could Antony hurried round the ditch and took up his place at the back of the seat Then he stood up with a yawn stretched himself and said carelessly Well don t worry yourself about it Bill old man I daresay you re right You know Mark and I don t and that s the difference Shall we have a game or shall we go to bed Bill looked at him for inspiration and receiving it said Oh just let,E
Expect him at three or thereabouts _ No date mentioned you see said Antony Just to morrow But he got this on Tuesday Did he Well he read it out to us on Tuesday Oh yes he read it out to you Bill read the letter again and then turned it over and looked at the back of it The back of it had nothing to say to him What about the postmark he asked We haven t got the envelope unfortunately And you think that he got this letter on Monday I m inclined to think so Bill Anyhow,E
what remained Accidental death justifiable homicide and murder Could the deceased have been killed accidentally It was possible but then would Mark Ablett have run away The evidence that he had run away from the scene of the crime was strong His cousin had seen him go into the room the servant Elsie Wood had heard him quarrelling with his brother in the room the door had been locked from the inside and there were signs that outside the open window some one had pushed his way very recently through the shrubbery Who if not Mark They would have then,E
I Now now get on Audrey Just going darling She went out To anyone who had just walked down the drive in the August sun the open door of the Red House revealed a delightfully inviting hall of which even the mere sight was cooling It was a big low roofed oak beamed place with cream washed walls and diamond paned windows blue curtained On the right and left were doors leading into other living rooms but on the side which faced you as you came in were windows again looking on to a small grass court and from open,E
suggest It seems sound enough said Bill Sort of thing you d do without thinking Besides if you are going to run away it gives you more of a chance Yes that s all right if the key is there But suppose it isn t there The suggestion made as if it were already an established fact startled them both They looked at him wonderingly What do you mean said Cayley Well it s just a question of where people happen to keep their keys You go up to your bedroom and perhaps you like to lock your door in,E
the passage for themselves But I don t want to do that yet Rather not So we ve got to carry on secretly for a bit It s the only way He smiled and added And it s much more fun Rather Bill chuckled to himself Very well Where does the secret passage begin CHAPTER XI The Reverend Theodore Ussher There s one thing which we have got to realize at once said Antony and that is that if we don t find it easily we shan t find it at all You mean that we shan t have time,E
to be liked by him Yes You see things are going to happen here soon Inquests and that sort of thing Well perhaps something before that Hallo here comes Cayley Cayley was walking across the lawn towards them a big heavy shouldered man with one of those strong clean shaven ugly faces which can never quite be called plain Bad luck on Cayley said Bill I say ought I to tell him how sorry I am and all that sort of thing It seems so dashed inadequate I shouldn t bother said Antony Cayley nodded as he came to them,E
play up to me Why is that fence useful my dear Holmes said Bill obediently Because you can take a bearing on it You see Yes you needn t stop to explain to me what a bearing is I wasn t going to But you re lying here he looked up underneath this pine tree Cayley comes out in the old boat and drops his parcel in You take a line from here on to the boat and mark it off on the fence there Say it s the fifth post from the end Well then I take a line,E
Then where is he going The library probably To consult our friend Ussher After making quite sure that his friends Beverley and Gillingham really _were_ going to Jallands as they said Bill stopped suddenly in the middle of the path I say do you think so Antony shrugged his shoulders I shouldn t be surprised We must be devilishly inconvenient for him hanging about the house Any moment he can get when we re definitely somewhere else must be very useful to him Useful for what Well useful for his nerves if for nothing else We know he s mixed,E
stairs rooms are always outside the doors Sometimes they are no doubt but I think we shall probably find that these are inside Oh well of course if they are inside then your original theory is probably the correct one Having often seen them outside I just wondered that s all You asked me to be quite frank you know and tell you what I thought But no doubt you re right and we shall find them inside as you say Even if the key was outside went on Cayley stubbornly I still think it might have been accidental He,E
door in the wall That s it Bill And it s locked And I m frightened of what s behind it But then we shall never know what s there if we aren t going to look We shall know to night said Antony taking Bill s arm and leading him to the hall when we watch our dear friend Cayley dropping it into the pond CHAPTER XV Mrs Norbury Confides in Dear Mr Gillingham They left the road and took the path across the fields which sloped gently downwards towards Jallands Antony was silent and since it is difficult,E
sir You didn t think of going back to the hall to see what had happened Oh no sir I just went in to Mrs Stevens and she said Oh what was that frightened like And I said That was in the house Mrs Stevens that was Just like something going off it was Thank you said the Coroner There was another emotional disturbance in the room as Cayley went into the witness box not _Sensation_ this time but an eager and as it seemed to Antony sympathetic interest Now they were getting to grips with the drama He gave,E
once so as to identify him afterwards and he agreed that it would be middlin hard and then Give me three guesses interrupted Antony You asked him if he remembered everybody who came to his inn That s it Bright wasn t it Brilliant And what was the result The result was a woman A woman said Antony eagerly A woman said Bill impressively Of course I thought it was going to be Robert so did you didn t you but it wasn t It was a woman Came quite late on Monday night in a car driving herself went,E
for a pair of independent and very keen eyes to do then he must investigate either with his host s approval or from beneath the roof of some other host the landlord of The George for instance who had no feelings in the matter For of one thing Antony was certain Cayley knew more than he professed to know That is to say he knew more than he wanted other people to know he knew Antony was one of the other people if therefore he was for trying to find out what it was that Cayley knew he could hardly,E
of a mother but he might have learnt something by listening to her For which of them had she the greater feeling Cayley or Mark Was she really prepared to marry Mark Did she love him or the other or neither Mrs Norbury was only a trustworthy witness in regard to her own actions and thoughts he had learnt all that was necessary of those and only the daughter now had anything left to tell him But Mrs Norbury was still talking Girls are so foolish Mr Gillingham she was saying It is fortunate that they have mothers to guide,E
know Keeping himself to himself We didn t see so very much of him except at meals We were here to enjoy ourselves and well _he_ wasn t He wasn t there when the ghost walked No I heard Mark calling for him when he went back to the house I expect Cayley stroked down his feathers a bit and told him that girls will be girls Hallo here we are They went into the inn and while Bill made himself pleasant to the landlady Antony went upstairs to his room It appeared that he had not very much packing,E
had been back since No Not to my knowledge Mark still obviously upset returned to his letter Personally said Bill I think relations are a great mistake All the same said Betty a little daringly it must be rather fun having a skeleton in the cupboard Mark looked up frowning If you think it s fun I ll hand him over to you Betty If he s anything like he used to be and like his few letters have been well Cay knows Cayley grunted All I knew was that one didn t ask questions about him It may have,E
